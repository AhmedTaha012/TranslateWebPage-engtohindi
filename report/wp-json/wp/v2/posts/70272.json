I was one of the students who took the first of these courses, an Artificial Intelligence course from Stanford.<\/p>\n<p>When I took the course, they weren\u2019t called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/help\/moocs\">MOOCs<\/a>, just Stanford online courses. Sometime during the first year, people started calling them MOOCs, for Massive Open Online Courses. It not only stuck but eventually led the New York Times to declare 2012 \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/04\/education\/edlife\/massive-open-online-courses-are-multiplying-at-a-rapid-pace.html\">The Year of the MOOC<\/a>\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Last month, I wrote about how the hype surrounding MOOCs set things in motion and might have had a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocs-tiktok\/\">bigger impact than MOOCs themselves<\/a>. In this article, I want to give you a sense of how this hype felt: a simple experiment that grew into a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocs-stats-and-trends-2019\/\">global phenomenon<\/a> with 120 million learners, 13.5 thousand courses, 900+ universities, and 50 online degrees from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/mooc-providers-list\/\">providers all over the world<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-73366\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/growth-2020.png\" alt=\"Growth of MOOCs 2020\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/growth-2020.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/growth-2020-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/growth-2020-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Simply put, here\u2019s the story of how Stanford\u2019s online courses evolved into MOOCs.<\/p>\n<p>(The article is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=N6XEIX1cVkY&amp;t=740s\">based on a keynote<\/a> on the evolution of MOOCs that I gave back in 2017 at a conference organized in Bangkok by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thaicyberu.go.th\/\">Thailand Cyber University<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<h3>July 2011: Stanford\u2019s Online Intro to AI is Announced<\/h3>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Online Introduction to Artificial Intelligence\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Kvja81g_lQ4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>In July 2011, Sebastian Thrun announced through his personal Youtube channel that he and Peter Norvig would be offering a Stanford course \u2014 CS221 Introduction to AI \u2014 online for free at ai-class.org (which now redirects to Udacity, an edtech startup later founded by Thrun).<\/p>\n<p>The course would be offered both to on-campus students at Stanford and to online learners around the globe. Online learners would be graded the same way as on-campus students.<\/p>\n<p>Ten days later, Thrun released <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YuJwMoubGFk\">another video<\/a> detailing how the course would work. This video also included Peter Norvig. Note that in the description of both videos, the word \u201cMOOC\u201d or \u201cUdacity\u201d never appears. We will come back to this later.<\/p>\n<h3>August 2011: Databases and Machine Learning Courses are Announced<\/h3>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Machine Learning: About the class\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/e0WKJLovaZg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>A month later, Stanford professors announced two more online courses \u2014 one of them taught by Andrew Ng, who posted the announcement on his personal YouTube channel. Ng would go on to co-found Coursera.<\/p>\n<p>Ng would teach a Machine Learning introduction at ml-class.org (which now redirects to Coursera), while Jennifer Widom would teach a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ShjrtAQmIVg\">Databases introduction<\/a> at db-class.org (which now redirects to Lagunita, Stanford\u2019s own MOOC platform).<\/p>\n<p>Again, no mention of MOOCs or Coursera.<\/p>\n<h3>August 2011: 58,000 Learners Sign Up<\/h3>\n<p>Within a month of its announcement, simply through word of mouth, the AI class had managed to enroll 58,000 learners.<\/p>\n<p>This led to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/08\/16\/science\/16stanford.html\">first of many<\/a> articles about Stanford\u2019s free online courses published by the New York Times, who I think played a key role in generating the hype around MOOCs.<\/p>\n<h3>October 2011: Stanford\u2019s First Three Courses Go Live<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-70286\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Evolution-of-MOOCs.014.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Evolution-of-MOOCs.014.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Evolution-of-MOOCs.014-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Evolution-of-MOOCs.014-768x576.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>On October 10th, 2011, Stanford\u2019s three online courses went live, each with close to or well above 100 thousand students. I was one of those students, taking Introduction to AI.<\/p>\n<h3>October \u2013 November 2011: Stanford Announces More Courses<\/h3>\n<p>While the original three courses were in progress, more courses were announced by Stanford, each with its own website \u2014 for instance, hci-class.org (which now redirects to Coursera).<\/p>\n<h3>November 28th, 2011: Class Central is Launched<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-70276\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Screenshot_2020-02-04-Class-Central-Summary-of-Stanfords-free-online-courses.png\" alt=\"Class Central Version 1\" width=\"1200\" height=\"614\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Screenshot_2020-02-04-Class-Central-Summary-of-Stanfords-free-online-courses.png 1200w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Screenshot_2020-02-04-Class-Central-Summary-of-Stanfords-free-online-courses-300x154.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Screenshot_2020-02-04-Class-Central-Summary-of-Stanfords-free-online-courses-768x393.png 768w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Screenshot_2020-02-04-Class-Central-Summary-of-Stanfords-free-online-courses-1024x524.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I was getting excited about Stanford\u2019s online courses. So over Thanksgiving weekend 2011, I built a one-page website to keep track of them. Initially, all I wanted was to sort the courses according to their start date. Thus, Class Central was born, with a list of 16 online courses. The name was inspired by the \u201c-class.org\u201d used by Stanford for its courses.<\/p>\n<h3>December 19th, 2011: MITx is Announced<\/h3>\n<p>One month later, MIT <a href=\"http:\/\/news.mit.edu\/2011\/mitx-education-initiative-1219\">announced<\/a> MITx, an initiative to offer online courses through an open-source learning platform designed in-house. The initiative was led by Anant Agarwal, who would later become CEO of edX.<\/p>\n<p>Once again, note that the word \u201cMOOC\u201d isn\u2019t in the announcement.<\/p>\n<h3>January 18th, 2012: Coursera Goes Live<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-69011\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/A-Product-at-Every-Price.020.jpeg\" alt=\"Coursera original mission statement\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/A-Product-at-Every-Price.020.jpeg 1920w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/A-Product-at-Every-Price.020-300x169.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/A-Product-at-Every-Price.020-768x432.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/A-Product-at-Every-Price.020-1024x576.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" \/>On January 18th, 2012, Coursera\u2019s website went live with the mission statement: \u201cWe are committed to making the best education in the world freely available to any person who seeks it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At the time, Coursera had no business model, and it wasn\u2019t clear whether it was a non-profit.<\/p>\n<p>A few days later, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.insidehighered.com\/news\/2012\/01\/24\/stanford-open-course-instructors-spin-profit-company\">Inside Higher Ed<\/a> revealed that Coursera could be a for-profit company led by Stanford professors Daphne Koller and Andrew Ng. In the article, the word \u201cMOOC\u201d appears for the first time (as far as I can tell) to refer to Stanford\u2019s online courses.<\/p>\n<h3>January 23rd, 2012: Udacity is Announced<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-70277\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Screenshot_2020-02-04-Udacity-Educating-the-21st-Century.png\" alt=\"Udacity first homepage\" width=\"1200\" height=\"614\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Screenshot_2020-02-04-Udacity-Educating-the-21st-Century.png 1200w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Screenshot_2020-02-04-Udacity-Educating-the-21st-Century-300x154.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Screenshot_2020-02-04-Udacity-Educating-the-21st-Century-768x393.png 768w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Screenshot_2020-02-04-Udacity-Educating-the-21st-Century-1024x524.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The team behind the AI class announced a new platform called Udacity and led by Sebastian Thrun.

They also announced new university partners: Princeton, the University of Michigan, and the University of Pennsylvania.<\/p>\n<p>On April 23rd, Coursera\u2019s first courses started. Coursera considers this period the birth of the platform and celebrates its anniversary each year in late April.<\/p>\n<p>By then, the publications that wrote about Coursera\u2019s funding round are still not using the word \u201cMOOC.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>May 2nd, 2012: Harvard and MIT Announce edX<\/h3>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"edX: The Future of Online Education is Now\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/SA6ELdIRkRU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>On May 2nd, 2012, Harvard and MIT <a href=\"http:\/\/news.mit.edu\/2012\/mit-harvard-edx-announcement-050212\">announced<\/a> the creation of edX.
