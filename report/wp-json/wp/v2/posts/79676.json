Data structures help us hold data and provide affordances for efficiently manipulating it, while algorithms represent tried-and-tested computational recipes to accomplish particular goals. Let me explain how it all works.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Human thinking may seem flexible and seemingly unconstrained, but in truth, we have a flurry of biological limitations. For instance, we typically can only hold in our short-term memory about 7 items \u2014 the famous <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">magical number 7<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, computers have similar limitations. They have limited resources that constrain what can be accomplished with software in a number of ways: computers can only store so much data in memory, and computers can only perform so many operations per second \u2014 most notably, CPUs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That said, there are many ways of taking advantage of computer resources, some more efficient than others. Data structures in particular, as their name suggests, allow to organize information in such a way that it can efficiently be leveraged in certain contexts. There are many data structures, each with their strengths and weaknesses. A good developer should know the fundamental data structures and when to use each. They\u2019re essential components of many applications, and they\u2019re ubiquitous in high-performance computing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An algorithm is a series of step-by-step instructions that aims to achieve a particular goal. They\u2019re general methods for tackling similar problems \u2014 for example, finding a name in a sorted list of names, or finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data structure and algorithms often work hand-in-hand. A particular algorithm typically leverages a particular data structure. Well thought out combinations of algorithms and data structures can help minimize the running time and memory needed to perform certain operations, thus saving a lot of time and money in the process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a wide arsenal of data structures and algorithms at your disposal grants you the freedom to choose the most appropriate solution to code whatever you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another major reason why you should learn data structures and algorithms is that many giant tech companies like Microsoft and Google include them in their interviews. During technical interviews, you\u2019ll be asked to solve computing problems that don\u2019t simply involve picking an appropriate data structure or algorithm but also implementing them and showing the interviewer that you indeed understand their strengths and weaknesses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-79247 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Course Ranking Methodology<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I built this ranking following the now tried-and-tested methodology I used in previous rankings (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/category\/best-courses\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you can find them all here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). It involves a three-step process:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>First<\/strong>, let me introduce myself. I\u2019m part of the Class Central team, and I (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@Elham\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">@elham<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) built this ranking in collaboration with my friend and colleague <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@manoel\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">@manoel<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We began with a purely data-driven process by leveraging Class Central\u2019s database of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">100K courses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to make a preliminary selection of DSA courses. We took a look at things like ratings, reviews, and course bookmarks to bring you some of the most popular DSA courses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But we didn\u2019t stop there. Ratings and reviews rarely tell the whole story. So the next step was to bring our personal knowledge of online education into the mix.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Second<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we used our experience as online learners to evaluate each preliminary pick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both of us come from computer science backgrounds and are prolific online learners, having completed about 45 MOOCs between us. Additionally, Manoel has an<\/span>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/open-university-insiders-perspective\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">online bachelor\u2019s in computer science<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, while I am currently completing my foundation in computer science. So we know our way around algorithms and data structures!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By carefully analyzing each course and bouncing ideas off each other, we\u2019ve made iterative improvements to the rankings until we were both satisfied.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Third<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, during our research, we stumbled across courses that we felt were well-made but weren\u2019t well-known. Had we adopted a purely data-centric approach, we would be forced to leave those courses out of the ranking just because they had fewer enrollments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To avoid this, we have decided instead to take a more holistic approach. We spiced up the ranking by including a wide range of courses on data structure and algorithms that will hopefully cater to different reader\u2019s preferences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After going through this process \u2014 combining Class Central data, our experience as lifelong learners, and a lot of editing \u2014 we arrived at our final ranking.

It covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To take this course, you\u2019ll need some familiarity with Java, including loops, arrays, functions, recursion, and objects, as well as high-school algebra.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course covers three main topics: data types, sorting, and searching.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A data type is an attribute of data which shows how a programmer intends to use the data. The course introduces a variety of data types. You\u2019ll first learn about the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Disjoint-set_data_structure\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">union-find<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> data type by considering the dynamic connectivity problem\u2009\u2014\u2009given a grid, is there a connected path between points A and B?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, you\u2019ll study the fundamental data types for storing collections of objects: the stack and the queue. You\u2019ll learn how to implement each using either a singly-linked list or a resizing array, and then consider various applications of stacks and queues ranging from parsing arithmetic expressions to simulating queueing systems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll also learn about the priority queue data type, along with its implementation using the binary heap data structure. You\u2019ll discuss the applications of priority queues by simulating the motion of n particles.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An algorithm that orders the elements of a list is called a sorting algorithm. Starting with the elementary sorting methods (selection sort and insertion sort), you\u2019ll consider two algorithms for uniformly shuffling an array. Moving on to more advanced algorithms, you\u2019ll study mergesort and quicksort. You\u2019ll analyze their performance and then compare the best situations to use them. You\u2019ll also learn about heapsort, which uses the binary heap data structure, as well as radix sorts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While sorting algorithms order elements, searching algorithms work to retrieve information stored within data structures. To guarantee a logarithmic performance for search and insert, you\u2019ll develop a symbol table which associates values with keys (think of associative arrays, or dictionaries).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, you\u2019ll learn about hash tables and hash functions, which allow you to map keys and values for efficient retrieval. You\u2019ll describe what a good hash function should have, and then learn to implement them in Java. Then, you\u2019ll consider two strategies for implementing hash tables to yield constant-time performance for search and insert.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course is 6 weeks long, with a study commitment of roughly 6\u201310 hours per week. There are two lectures per week, each broken up into about 4\u22126 segments and separated by interactive quiz questions to help you process and understand the material.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regarding assessments, there are 5 lengthy coding assignments about data structures and algorithms to complete. Additionally, the course also provides a few algorithmic job interview questions based on the material for the week which are inspired by questions asked at leading technology companies.<\/span><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Princeton University<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coursera<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructors<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intermediate<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">60 hours total<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Enrollments<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">929K<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Rating<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.9 \/ 5.0 (9.4K)<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fun Facts<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course has 19.4K bookmarks on Class Central.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next part of the course is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/algs4partII-340\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Algorithms, Part II<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, focusing on graph-processing and string-processing algorithms, as well as reductions and intractability.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course can also be accompanied by the free online book <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/algs4.cs.princeton.edu\/home\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Algorithms, 4th Edition<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, of which the instructors are co-authors.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re interested in this course, you can find <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/algs4partI-339\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more information about the course and how to enroll here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/edx-algorithms-design-and-analysis-part-1-8984\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1 (Stanford University)<\/span><\/a><\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_79682\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79682\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-79682 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/2.-algorithms-stanford.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/2.-algorithms-stanford.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/2.-algorithms-stanford-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/2.-algorithms-stanford-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-79682\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tim Roughgarden, course instructor<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My 2nd pick for the best DSA course is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/edx-algorithms-design-and-analysis-part-1-8984\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, offered by Stanford University on edX.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you will learn several fundamental principles of algorithm design and the data structures they rely on.

You\u2019ll then be able to determine the running time of most of the divide-and-conquer algorithms you&#8217;ll ever see!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After that, you\u2019ll study the problem of computing the i<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> smallest element of an input array. By using the Quick Sort algorithm instead of a na\u00efve approach, you\u2019ll do this in linear time instead of O(n log n) time \u2014 a vast improvement!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course then shifts gears to graph theory. First, you\u2019ll review graphs and the most standard ways of representing them (using adjacency lists). You\u2019ll also learn a simple but useful trick for transforming an algorithm that almost always fails into one that almost always succeeds. Then, you\u2019ll cover a selection of fundamental primitives for reasoning about graphs and graph search, which are all blazingly fast! All this buildup has been in anticipation of one of the most-famous algorithms ever \u2014<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freecodecamp.org\/news\/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-visual-introduction\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2009Dijkstra&#8217;s shortest-path<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final few sections of the course consists of lessons on data structures\u2009\u2014\u2009heaps, binary search trees, and hash tables. The aim is to teach you the operations that these data structures support (along with their running times), as well as to develop your intuition about which data structures are useful for which sorts of problems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll end with a bang by learning how heaps and binary search trees are really useful (they are used in Dijkstra&#8217;s algorithm) and also how constructing effective hash functions enables hash tables to search in linear time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing to note is that the course contains a lot of optional lectures that dive deeper into the theory behind the algorithms you\u2019ve learnt, if you\u2019d like to satisfy your intellectual hunger.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course is 6 weeks long with an estimated workload of 2\u20134 hours per week, where you\u2019ll learn through video lectures and slides.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regarding assessments, you\u2019ll practice and master the fundamentals of algorithms through several types of assignments. There are 6 multiple-choice quizzes to test your understanding of the most important concepts along with 6 programming assignments, where you\u2019ll implement one of the algorithms covered in the lectures in any programming language you want. You can only complete these assessments if you\u2019re paying for the certificate.<\/span><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stanford University<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">edX<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tim Roughgarden<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intermediate<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">24 hours total<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Enrollments<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">45K<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paid<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fun Facts<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course has 913 bookmarks on Class Central.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next course you should take after this is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/edx-algorithms-design-and-analysis-part-2-19393\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 2<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tim Roughgarden is the Professor of Computer Science and member of the Data Science Institute at Columbia University.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He received the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/G%C3%B6del_Prize\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">G\u00f6del Prize<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2012 for his work on routing traffic in large-scale communication networks to optimize performance of a congested network.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My colleague <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@dhawal\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">@dhawal<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> also <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/coding-interviews-stanford-courses\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wrote about the course here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">!<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re interested in this course, you can find <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/edx-algorithms-design-and-analysis-part-1-8984\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more information about the course and how to enroll here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"3\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/freecodecamp-algorithms-and-data-structures-tutorial-full-course-for-beginners-57067\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Algorithms and Data Structures Tutorial (Treehouse)<\/span><\/a><\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_79681\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79681\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-79681 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/3.-algorithms-treehouse.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/3.-algorithms-treehouse.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/3.-algorithms-treehouse-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/3.-algorithms-treehouse-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-79681\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pasan Premaratne, course co-instructor<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My third pick for the best algorithms and data structures course is the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/freecodecamp-algorithms-and-data-structures-tutorial-full-course-for-beginners-57067\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Algorithms and Data Structures Tutorial<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> offered by Treehouse on freeCodeCamp\u2019s YouTube channel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course is excellent for beginners. It teaches you all about algorithms and data structures, giving you the intuition behind each algorithm and data structure while avoiding flooding you with mathematical details.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the end of the course, you will understand what algorithms and data structures are, how they are implemented and evaluated, and how they are used to solve problems.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are three main parts to this course: algorithms, data structures, and a deep dive into sorting and searching algorithms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course begins by answering the question: What is an algorithm? An algorithm is a set of steps a program takes to finish a task. You\u2019ll see how this seemingly simple definition actually forms the foundation of executing many real-world applications. Your first introduction to algorithms comes in the game: Guess the number! Then, you\u2019ll move onto more search algorithms, like linear search and binary search.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given that there may be multiple algorithms to finish a task, how do we find the one which saves us the most time in the worst-case or best-case scenario? This question of time complexity is solved by the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Big_O_notation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Big O notation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You\u2019ll learn how we use the Big O notation to measure and determine how long an algorithm is estimated to finish given some input, and describe the time taken as linear, quadratic, quasilinear, or exponential time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, you\u2019ll get to coding linear and binary search in Python. You\u2019ll learn more about the fundamental concept of recursion when implementing recursive binary search. You\u2019ll also need to keep in mind space complexity\u2009\u2014\u2009how much storage is needed for an algorithm to function.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After that, you\u2019ll be introduced to your first data structure: arrays. You\u2019ll learn what arrays are, as well as how to access, search, insert and delete values from them. You\u2019ll also learn another important data structure called linked lists. You\u2019ll see how linked lists are more flexible than arrays, and compare the differences between them. You\u2019ll study the merge sort algorithm, how to sort a linked list with them, and how to evaluate its efficiency.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course then looks at sorting and searching algorithms, and how to implement them in Python. You\u2019ll learn and code Bogosort, Quicksort, Merge Sort, and also gain a different perspective on Linear Search and Binary Search. You\u2019ll learn how to measure the Big-O run time of each of these algorithms with Python. Lastly, you\u2019ll see how these algorithms can be used for real-world applications.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course will take you approximately 6 hours to complete, and consists of several video lectures filled with visualizations. You are expected to follow along with the course instructors while they are coding to further cement your understanding.<\/span><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Organization<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Treehouse<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">freeCodeCamp<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructors<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pasan Premaratne and Jay McGavren<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginner<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6 hours long<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Views<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1.7M<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Likes<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">57K<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">None<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fun Facts<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Treehouse offers <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/teamtreehouse.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">many other programming courses on their website<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pasan is a iOS, Swift and Computer Science teacher at Treehouse, while Jay is the author of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.oreilly.com\/library\/view\/head-first-ruby\/9781449372644\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Head First Ruby<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.oreilly.com\/library\/view\/head-first-go\/9781491969540\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Head first Go<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, both published by O&#8217;Reilly Media.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re interested in this course, you can find <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/freecodecamp-algorithms-and-data-structures-tutorial-full-course-for-beginners-57067\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more information about the course and how to enroll here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/youtube-mit-6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2020-66373\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6.006 Introduction to Algorithms (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)<\/span><\/a><\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_79687\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79687\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-79687 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/4.-aogorithms-mit.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/4.-aogorithms-mit.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/4.-aogorithms-mit-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/4.-aogorithms-mit-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-79687\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Erik Demaine, course instructor<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/youtube-mit-6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2020-66373\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6.006 Introduction to Algorithms<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an introduction to mathematical modeling of computational problems. It is demanding (as expected from an MIT course) but also rewarding if you\u2019re up for the challenge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It covers elementary data structures (dynamic arrays, heaps, balanced binary search trees, hash tables) and algorithmic approaches to solve classical problems (sorting, graph searching, dynamic programming). The course emphasizes the relationship between algorithms and programming and introduces basic performance measures and analysis techniques for these problems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To take this course, you\u2019ll need basic experience programming in Python 3 and basic knowledge of discrete mathematics. You can try completing <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ocw.mit.edu\/courses\/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science\/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2020\/assignments\/MIT6_006S20_ps0-questions.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Problem Set 0<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to see if this course is right for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course starts off with the goal of teaching you how to solve computation problems and communicate that your solutions are correct and efficient. You\u2019ll learn what algorithms are and how to measure how fast it takes for them to produce a correct output using the Big O notation. You\u2019ll also learn that data structures are a way for programs to store data, with algorithms that support operations on the data.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, you\u2019ll learn about sets and sorting. Sorting a set of elements is important because one of the fastest searching algorithms, binary search, presupposes that the set of elements has already been sorted. Hence, you\u2019ll learn about Permutation Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort. But if you want faster search and dynamic operations, you\u2019ll need to learn about hashing, chaining, and hash functions, to come up with a hash table that accesses data in linear time. This will allow you to also achieve a faster sort by using algorithms like Tuple Sort, Counting Sort, and Radix Sort!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course then moves on to binary trees. You\u2019ll study their terminology, variations, as well as how to navigate and operate them. A binary tree is balanced if it maintains O(log n) height under dynamic operations, and AVL trees are an example of that. This will lead you to learning about binary heaps and priority queues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Afterwards, you\u2019ll be given a lesson on graph theory and its terms. Graphs are everywhere from road networks to chess. The most common graph representation is by adjacency lists. With this, you\u2019ll learn and understand the difference between breadth-first search and depth-first search, which are the elementary search algorithms that make up the more complex ones.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next few lessons focus on finding the shortest-path weights in weighted graphs. You\u2019ll cover the Bellman-Ford algorithm, Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm, APSP algorithm and Johnson algorithm. You\u2019ll understand the underlying concepts and compare the running time of each of these algorithms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final classes introduce you to dynamic programming and its features. Dynamic programming is a weird term coined by\u00a0 Richard Bellman, who wanted government funding but needed a cool name to disguise doing mathematics!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll learn and design your own recursive algorithms. For example, you\u2019ll code the Fibonacci sequence, alternating coin names, arithmetic parenthesization, and even piano fingering. Lastly, you\u2019ll relate what you\u2019ve learned about complexity with polynomial and pseudo polynomial time which are characteristic of some dynamically-programmed algorithms.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course has 13 weeks of lectures, and the course videos add up to about 36 hours. The video lectures are uploaded to YouTube. The course also includes supplemental resources like course notes, course assignments and their solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Massachusetts Institute of Technology<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MITOpenCourseWare<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructors<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Erik Demaine<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intermediate<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">36 hours total<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Views<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">405K<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Rating<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">9K<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">None<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fun Facts<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/erikdemaine.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Erik Demaine<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a professor of Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former child prodigy.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He completed his bachelor&#8217;s degree at the age of 14 and completed his PhD by the time he was 20 years old!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He is reportedly the youngest professor in the history of MIT.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re interested in this course, you can find <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/youtube-mit-6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2020-66373\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more information about the course and how to enroll here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"5\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/data-structures-algorithms-i-arraylists-linkedlis-23256\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data Structures &amp; Algorithms I: ArrayLists, LinkedLists, Stacks and Queues (Georgia Institute of Technology)<\/span><\/a><\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_79685\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79685\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-79685 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/5.-data-structures-algorithms-georgia-tech.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/5.-data-structures-algorithms-georgia-tech.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/5.-data-structures-algorithms-georgia-tech-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/5.-data-structures-algorithms-georgia-tech-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-79685\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Big O notation and growth rate<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/data-structures-algorithms-i-arraylists-linkedlis-23256\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data Structures &amp; Algorithms I<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> aims to empower computer scientists in training like you with the actual building blocks to create data structures and algorithms that make programs come alive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Available on edX, this course provides an overview of basic linear data structures and the algorithms that operate on those structures. By the end of the course, you\u2019ll understand the fundamental principles of linear data structures and you\u2019ll be able to differentiate between those linear structures, implement them efficiently, and analyze their performance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The prerequisites for the course are basic knowledge of the Java programming language and object oriented principles.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will examine ArrayLists, LinkedLists, Stacks, Queues, and Deques, and analyze their operations and time complexity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the first module, you\u2019ll review important Java principles involved in object-oriented design, from constructors to references. You\u2019ll delve into the challenging concept of Big-O and how to measure time complexity at a high level. Lastly, you\u2019ll discern when to use Iterator and Iterable, and understand how to use comparable and comparator in practical Java code.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second module introduces you to Arrays &amp; ArrayLists. After a review of the concept of recursion and exploring recursion&#8217;s principal function within data structures, you\u2019ll implement recursive methods on them. Additionally, you\u2019ll be able to describe the behavior of the data structure without concerning yourself with the low-level implementation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Linked Lists is what the third module will cover. You\u2019ll study the basics of linked data structures by learning about the Singly-Linked List, an implementation of the List abstract data type, and learn about variations of the Linked List concept: Doubly-Linked Lists and Circularly-Linked Lists. You\u2019ll then practice the ideas of iteration and recursion on Linked Lists both conceptually and through code.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fourth and final module will teach you about Stacks and Queues. You\u2019ll start by understanding the concepts of two fundamental abstract data types, Stacks and Queues, which you\u2019ll then implement using Arrays and LinkedLists with minimal overhead. This brings us to Priority Queues and Deques, variations of Stacks and Queues. You\u2019ll apply their conceptual and implementation knowledge to better understand Priority Queues and Deques as a whole, which you\u2019ll then build on in Part 2 of the course series.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course is 5 weeks long, and you\u2019re expected to spend 9\u201310 hours per week learning. You will watch a series of short videos explaining the concepts interspersed with interactive exercises to check your understanding. You will also have a visualization exploratory lab to dive deeper into understanding the data structures and algorithms.<\/span><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Georgia Institute of Technology<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">edX<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mary Hudachek-Buswell<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intermediate<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">50 hours total<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Enrollments<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">13K<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paid<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fun Facts<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mary Hudachek-Buswell is a professor in the Computer Science department at Georgia Institute of Technology.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is one of the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/most-popular-courses-2022\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">100 most popular free online courses in 2022<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data Structures &amp; Algorithms I<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is part of the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/gtx-data-structures-and-algorithms-23753\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data Structures and Algorithms Professional Certificate<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re interested in this course, you can find <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/data-structures-algorithms-i-arraylists-linkedlis-23256\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more information about the course and how to enroll here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"6\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/algorithmic-toolbox-5471\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Algorithmic Toolbox (University of California, San Diego)<\/span><\/a><\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_79684\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79684\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-79684 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/6.-algorithmic-toolbox-uc-san-diego.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/6.-algorithmic-toolbox-uc-san-diego.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/6.-algorithmic-toolbox-uc-san-diego-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/6.-algorithmic-toolbox-uc-san-diego-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-79684\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alexander Kulikov, course co-instructor<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offered by the University of California, San Diego, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/algorithmic-toolbox-5471\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Algorithmic Toolbox<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> covers the basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems that come up frequently in everyday applications. It\u2019s super hands on: you\u2019ll implement a ton of algorithms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will learn how to sort data and how it helps for searching, how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively, when it makes sense to proceed greedily, and how dynamic programming is used in genomic studies. By practicing solving computational problems, designing new algorithms, and implementing efficient solutions, you\u2019ll become a better programmer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To take this course, you\u2019ll need basic knowledge of any programming language as well as some topics in discrete mathematics including proof by induction and proof by contradiction.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course covers sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, and dynamic programming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting with the first module, you\u2019ll go over an overview of where algorithms and data structures are used and tackle a few sample programming challenges, which will be abundant throughout the course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, the second module introduces you to algorithms. Programs based on efficient algorithms can solve the same problem billions of times faster than programs based on na\u00efve algorithms. In this module, you\u2019ll learn how to compare various algorithms and select the most efficient ones by estimating the running time and memory needs of an algorithm without even implementing it!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the third module you\u2019ll learn about a seemingly na\u00efve yet powerful class of algorithms called greedy algorithms. Although greedy algorithms can be extremely useful, they only work in certain situations. Hence, before using this sort of algorithm, it is important to prove that a greedy algorithm always produces an optimal solution. You\u2019ll gain intuition for building greedy algorithms by creating a program for changing money optimally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fourth module is all about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/computing\/computer-science\/algorithms\/merge-sort\/a\/divide-and-conquer-algorithms\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Divide and Conquer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Based on this technique, you\u2019ll learn how to search huge databases millions of times faster than using na\u00efve linear search. You will even learn that the standard way to multiply numbers is far from being the fastest! After that, you\u2019ll design two efficient algorithms (merge sort and quicksort) and apply them in a program that searches through huge lists, and finds a majority element. Finally, you\u2019ll prove that no other algorithm can sort faster!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, the fifth and sixth modules cover dynamic programming, a powerful algorithmic technique for solving many optimization problems. It turns out that dynamic programming solves many problems that are hard to solve with other methods like greedy algorithms or the divide-and-conquer strategy. Countless are the applications of dynamic programming: from maximizing the advertisement revenue of a TV station, to searching for similar Internet pages, to gene finding\u2009\u2014\u2009you name it! You\u2019ll learn and apply dynamic programming to implement efficient programs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course is 6 weeks long, with each week taking approximately 4\u20138 hours of study. The course supplies video lectures and additional resources for you to learn from. Additionally, each week comes with multiple programming assignments for you to test your knowledge, if you are paying for the certificate.<\/span><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University of California, San Diego<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coursera<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructors<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael Levin, Daniel M Kane, Alexander S.

Hence it is also great for anyone interested in web development.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While HTML and CSS control the content and styling of a page, JavaScript is used to make it interactive. In the JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification, you&#8217;ll learn the fundamentals of JavaScript including variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have the fundamentals down, you&#8217;ll apply that knowledge by creating algorithms to manipulate strings, factorialize numbers, and even calculate the orbit of the International Space Station.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along the way, you&#8217;ll also learn two important programming styles or paradigms: Object Oriented Programing (OOP), and Functional Programing (FP).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So this course is a great 2-in-1 option: you\u2019ll learn both programming and algorithms\/data structures.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course covers nine topics: Basic JavaScript, ES6, Regular Expressions, Debugging, Basic Data Structures, Basic Algorithm Scripting, Object Oriented Programming, Functional Programming, and Intermediate Algorithm Scripting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first few sections of the course teach the fundamentals of JavaScript programming like arrays, objects, functions, loops, if\/else statements, and more. It also teaches the ES6 features of the language like arrow functions, destructuring, classes, promises, and modules. You\u2019ll also learn how to match text patterns with Regular Expressions, along with learning how to debug your code using the JavaScript console.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, you\u2019ll move to the brunt of the course: Data Structures and Algorithms. You\u2019ll learn more about the differences between arrays and objects and which to use in different situations, as well as how to use methods like `splice()` and `Object.keys()` to access and manipulate data.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll then learn the fundamentals of algorithmic thinking by writing algorithms\u2009\u2014\u2009series of step-by-step instructions to accomplish a goal\u2009\u2014\u2009that do everything from converting temperatures to handling complex 2D arrays.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Afterwards, you\u2019ll study two programming paradigms: Object Oriented Programming and Functional Programming. In OOP, objects and classes organize code to describe things and what they can do, whereas in Functional Programming code is organized into smaller, basic functions that can be combined to build complex programs. Your knowledge of both paradigms will allow you to get the best of both worlds by writing more advanced programs like summing all primes or converting plain text to Pig Latin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course ends with five projects to put your JavaScript skills to the test. You\u2019ll build a palindrome checker, a roman numeral converter, caesars cipher encrypter, telephone number validator, and a cash register program.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course is 100\u2013200 hours long. The course is very hands-on: you\u2019ll write code from beginning to end. The most rewarding aspect of this course is the completion of the five projects needed to earn a free certificate, which you\u2019ll do all on your own.<\/span><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">freeCodeCamp<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginner<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">100\u2013200 hours total<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fun Facts<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course has hundreds of bookmarks on Class Central.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">freeCodeCamp is a nonprofit that helps people learn to code for free.

You\u2019ll then implement and compare the complexity of Binary Search and Linear Search, before learning about implementing linked lists using Python classes. Then, you\u2019ll study binary trees and how to traverse them, as well as the different types of binary trees and common operations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, you\u2019ll learn about hash tables with Python dictionaries. You\u2019ll learn how to handle collisions using linear probing, and then learn how to replicate the Python dictionary data structure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knowing the differences between sorting algorithms can help you speed up your code. For example, you\u2019ll study and analyze bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort. Using a strategy known as divide and conquer, you\u2019ll learn how to optimize polynomial multiplication and other algorithms. Lastly, you\u2019ll also learn how to analyze time and space complexity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dynamic programming is also a powerful method for optimizing your code. By tying in key concepts like recursion and memoization, you\u2019ll be able to apply them to a variety of problems, including the well-known <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Knapsack_problem\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">knapsack problem<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course then introduces you to graphs, trees, and adjacency lists which are used everywhere in computer science. You\u2019ll learn about breadth-first search and depth-first search, and find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final section of the course is all about teaching you how to think effectively as a programmer, as well as preparing and advising you for cracking coding interviews.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course is 12.5 hours long. The contents of the course are taught in a video lecture format, but you\u2019ll be provided with plenty of Jupyter Notebooks to practice coding along with the lecturer.<\/span><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jovian<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">freeCodeCamp<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aakash N C<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginner<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">13 hours total<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Views<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">626K<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Likes<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">21K<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fun Facts<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course is also available at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/jovian.ai\/learn\/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data Structures and Algorithms in Python<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jovian also offers <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.jovian.ai\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">many other Python courses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> related to Data Science, like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/jovian.ai\/learn\/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data Analysis with Python<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/jovian.ai\/learn\/machine-learning-with-python-zero-to-gbms\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Machine Learning with Python<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re interested in this course, you can find <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/freecodecamp-data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python-full-course-for-beginners-57034\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more information about the course and how to enroll here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"9\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">9. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/udemy-master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-32463\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms (Udemy)<\/span><\/a><\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_79678\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79678\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-79678 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/9.-master-the-coding-interview-udemy.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/9.-master-the-coding-interview-udemy.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/9.-master-the-coding-interview-udemy-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/9.-master-the-coding-interview-udemy-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-79678\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Graph traversal<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re a self-taught developer or anyone anxious about facing a technical interview, this language-agnostic course might be what you\u2019re looking for.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/udemy-master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-32463\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will help you cut through the technical interview process like a ninja.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only will it teach you about the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms and how to ace the coding questions given by leading companies like FAANG, it will also teach you the soft skills needed to increase your chances of getting accepted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another thing I like about this course is its focus on community. You\u2019ll have access to their private Discord server where you can get help, chat with other learners and mentors, and most importantly, keep yourself accountable.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course has two sides: technical and non-technical.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the technical side, you\u2019ll start by learning what makes code good. Any competent developer can write code, but what separates the best code from the rest? Enter time-complexity and space-complexity. You\u2019ll learn how to calculate how long your code might run and also how much space it might take up while running with the Big-O notation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have that sorted, you\u2019ll move on to data structures. A data structure is analogous to a container. You have many different containers like a cupboard, a fridge, a backpack, or a purse, but you wouldn\u2019t store ice cream in a cupboard nor money in a fridge! Hence, each data structure has its own advantages that makes it better suited for one thing than another.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll be taught some of the most common and important data structures, including arrays, hash tables, linked lists, stacks &amp; queues, trees, and graphs. You\u2019ll not only learn the theory behind each of them but also how and when to implement them in your code.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, you\u2019ll study algorithms. Algorithms are steps in a process that we take to perform a desired action with computers. Combining algorithms with data structures allows us to achieve some remarkable results!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After an introduction to recursion and having written some recursive algorithms yourself, you\u2019ll study sorting algorithms and searching algorithms. Sorting and searching is an important process for companies dealing with millions of items like Amazon and it is very computationally expensive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll learn bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort, and radix sort. You\u2019ll additionally learn about linear and binary search, as well as compare the differences between breadth-first search and depth-first search. Another thing you\u2019ll learn is dynamic programming, which is a technique that uses cache to optimize code.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the non-technical side of the course, you\u2019ll learn how to get more interviews by building a portfolio, become more confident and prepared for your next coding interview, and also how to professionally handle offers and negotiate raises.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although this course is 20 hours long, the course instructor recommends that you take at least a month to complete it. You\u2019ll mainly learn from watching the course videos, and also by putting theory into practice by coding along with the course and checking your code with the provided solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Udemy<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Andrei Neagoie<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intermediate<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">20 hours total<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Enrollments<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">143K<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Rating<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.7 \/ 5.0 (23K)<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paid<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fun Facts<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course has an extra section on how to contribute to open source.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Andrei is the instructor of some of the highest rated programming and technical courses online and is the founder of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/zerotomastery.io\/academy\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ZTM academy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He is also a self-taught programmer, and knows the struggles of being one.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re interested in this course, you can find <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/udemy-master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-32463\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more information about the course and how to enroll here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"10\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/udacity-intro-to-data-structures-and-algorithms-11457\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms (Google)<\/span><\/a><\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_79686\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79686\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-79686 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/10.-data-structures-and-algorithms-google.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/10.-data-structures-and-algorithms-google.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/10.-data-structures-and-algorithms-google-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/10.-data-structures-and-algorithms-google-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-79686\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Brynn Claypoole, course co-instructor<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re preparing for a technical interview but have either never taken a course on data structures or algorithms, or need a refresher, then this course is ideal for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offered by Google on Udacity, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/udacity-intro-to-data-structures-and-algorithms-11457\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms<\/em><\/a> will introduce you to common data structures and algorithms in Python to prepare you for technical interviews.

By the end of the course, you\u2019ll be ready for anything technical interviewers might throw at you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To take this course, you\u2019ll need to be comfortable with algebra and coding in Python.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note: this course uses Python 2 and not the latest version, Python 3, but the concepts are still relevant.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course begins with an introduction to efficiency. You\u2019ll define what efficiency means when applied to algorithms, as well as explain the Big O notation commonly used to describe efficiency.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, you\u2019ll learn about list-based collections. You\u2019ll see definitions and examples of list-based data structures, like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. After examining the efficiency of common list methods using what you\u2019ve been taught, you\u2019ll practice manipulating these data structures.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you have list-based data structures, the next thing you\u2019ll want to do is to know how to search and sort through them. You\u2019ll learn how to implement several algorithms (with recursion) like binary search, bubble sort, merge sort, and quick sort, as well as tell how efficient they are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course then introduces you to maps and hash functions. You\u2019ll understand and learn how to apply the concepts of sets, maps (dictionaries), and hashing to real-world problems.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, you\u2019ll learn about trees and paths, their concepts and terminology. You\u2019ll Investigate common tree types, such as binary search trees, heaps, and self-balancing trees and learn how to traverse and manipulate them. The same will be done with graphs, where you\u2019ll\u00a0 learn about their representations, properties, traversals, and paths, before analyzing their efficiency.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nearing the end of the course, you\u2019ll discuss a few famous computer science problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem. You\u2019ll learn how brute-force, greedy, and dynamic programming are used to solve them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, you\u2019ll learn about technical interviewing tips. You\u2019ll understand how to answer technical interview questions leveraging the concepts taught in this course. You\u2019ll gain some practice using <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pramp.com\/#\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pramp<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to meet with other students for mock interviews.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course runs for 4 weeks. Throughout the course, you\u2019ll learn concepts through video tutorials and watch experienced engineers explain their reasoning as they work their way through algorithmic problems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regarding assignments, there are plenty of practice coding exercises that you can work on to drill what you\u2019ve been taught.<\/span><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Udacity<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructors<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Horatio Thomas and Brynn Claypoole<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intermediate<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4 weeks long<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">None<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fun Facts<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Horatio is Student Experience Lead at Android while Brynn is a Lead Data Analyst at Udacity.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re interested in this course, you can find <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/udacity-intro-to-data-structures-and-algorithms-11457\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more information about the course and how to enroll here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ten carefully-chosen courses to help you become a better coder and prepare for technical interviews.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":110,"featured_media":79677,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[686],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.3 (Yoast SEO v18.5.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>10 Best Data Structures &amp;
