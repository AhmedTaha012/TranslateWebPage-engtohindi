Designed as a modern Lisp, Clojure runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and interoperates seamlessly with Java. It is a compiled language that emphasizes simplicity, concurrency, and immutability.<\/p>\n<p>One of the key strengths of Clojure is its strong support for concurrent programming, which allows developers to write code that can take advantage of multiple cores and processors. That is why companies <a href=\"https:\/\/clojure.org\/community\/companies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">like Walmart, Boeing, Netflix, Cisco, and others<\/a> that need to process large amounts of data quickly and accurately turn to Clojure to solve their problems. In addition, Clojure&#8217;s focus on immutability and purity makes it easier to write correct, reliable code that is less prone to errors and bugs.<\/p>\n<p>Clojure follows the philosophy of the Lisp family of languages known as code-as-data. This leads to another powerful strength of Clojure\u2009\u2014\u2009metaprogramming. Developers can modify and extend the language itself to define new language constructs (with macros) and control the evaluation of code. And since Clojure is a compiled language, efficient, high-performance code can be generated at runtime to create highly flexible and dynamic applications.<\/p>\n<p>As parallelized hardware becomes more accessible and the need for big data processing increases, the demand for developers who can work with these technologies will likely grow as well. In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/survey.stackoverflow.co\/2022\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according to the Stack Overflow Developer 2022 Survey<\/a>, Clojure developers are the highest-paid developers among all programming languages right now. So, if you are interested in a career in data-intensive fields, Clojure is definitely a language worth learning.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-79247 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png\" alt=\"Find your next course on Class Central.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Best Courses Guides Methodology<\/h2>\n<p>I built this ranking following the now tried-and-tested methodology used in previous Best Courses Guides (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/category\/best-courses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">you can find them all here<\/a>).

Designed for non-programmers like Liberal Arts students (although experienced programmers can benefit greatly too!), the aim of the course is for students to experience the joy of computer programming while at the same time developing programming skills advanced enough to enter the multi-threaded software development role.<\/p>\n<p>Do note that this course is challenging, and programmers may find themselves struggling more than non-programmers, so don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help.<\/p>\n<p>No prior experience with programming is required to take this course.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll begin the course with a historical overview of Clojure and its predecessor, Lisp. Then, see how you can interact with the computer through the command line with the REPL, before learning how to write mathematical and programmatic functions.<\/p>\n<p>Lists are the most fundamental data collection. You\u2019ll learn how and when to use them along with other collections like vectors, hash-maps, and hash-sets. Additionally, you\u2019ll learn how to bind values to symbols with def and let.<\/p>\n<p>Moving on, you\u2019ll study how to create sequences of numbers lazily. This means that you can store natural numbers up to infinity in memory, because expressions are only evaluated when needed. Laziness is a fundamental characteristic of functional programming, and you\u2019ll see the same concept apply when processing collections with map, filter, remove.<\/p>\n<p>Did you know that your programs can make decisions? You\u2019ll learn conditionals and logic operators to help you achieve this. You\u2019ll also learn what recursion is, how to destructure data with pattern-matching, and discover what side-effects are and how they affect the way you write code. Finally, you\u2019ll end the course by exploring how Clojure can be used to make collaborative programmable music and interactive drawings and animations<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 15 weeks long, with each week taking 9 hours of study (as the course is worth 3 credits).

These coding examples are animated, so you\u2019ll watch how an empty Clojure file grows into a useful program. The course is also taught from an object-oriented programmer&#8217;s perspective, so programmers coming from OOP languages don\u2019t need to worry!<\/p>\n<p>Some previous programming experience is required.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll begin the course by taking a look at the basic structure and syntax of a typical Clojure program. Then, you\u2019ll explore how to write expressions, before taking a look at data structures in Clojure (and why they can be both immutable and efficient). Afterward, you\u2019ll learn the unfamiliar way of writing functions in Clojure before investigating how to do I\/O by reading from and writing to a file.<\/p>\n<p>Clojure is named as so because functions can return another function as a return value, which is called closures in functional programming. Along with functional programming concepts like recursion and laziness, you\u2019ll see how you can utilize these amazing concepts in real-world programs rather than some esoteric use case.<\/p>\n<p>Macros is another powerful feature that more programming languages should have. They allow programmers to add features to the language that the language inventor never thought of adding. And finally, the last chapter of the course is all about concurrency and how Clojure makes it easy.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course consists of 7 chapters.

It covers everything you need to know about Clojure as well as provides many exercises and projects for you to practice on. By the end of the course, you\u2019ll be able to code meaningful programs in Clojure following the functional paradigm.<\/p>\n<p>You should have basic programming skills. No prior experience with functional programming is required.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>After setting up your development environment, you\u2019ll begin by learning how to use the interactive REPL, where you can write code and see it get executed immediately. Here, you\u2019ll practice writing the syntax and concepts you need to write basic Clojure statements and expressions. For example, you\u2019ll learn how to write conditionals and define functions.<\/p>\n<p>In Clojure, structured data is immutable. You\u2019ll learn what this means and how it affects the way you think about data structures like vectors, maps, and sets, including when using abstract sequences like maps and filters. Additionally, you\u2019ll also be enlightened with tips on writing the most idiomatic Clojure code. After that, you\u2019ll be given a project on evaluating poker hands.<\/p>\n<p>Moving on, you\u2019ll explore the function in functional programming deeper. You\u2019ll learn how functions have values and hence can also become the input of another function. You\u2019ll also learn how a function can call itself recursively in its own body, and see how recursion can help with sequences, numbers, and trees. Also, you\u2019ll realize that looping is a form of recursion and that recursion can be used to get a single result from a collection of items. Lastly, you\u2019ll analyze a blog engine written in Clojure before ending the course with a Sudoku solver project.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is worth 4 credits, or 112 hours total. You\u2019ll learn by reading the lecture articles and following along with them by doing the exercises. You\u2019ll also be given two big projects for you to work on and apply your Clojure skills.<\/p>\n<p>The course relies heavily on the use of third party cloud services.

After that, the basic common programming concepts will be highlighted to you, including data types, collections, bindings, and namespaces.<\/p>\n<p>Next, you\u2019ll become acquainted with how functions work and how to use them in the context of functional programming. In addition, you\u2019ll also know how to use control flow statements and how to test your code (important during production!). Another thing you\u2019ll figure out is how to interoperate Clojure code with Java code.<\/p>\n<p>One of the best things about Clojure is that it is easy to do parallel programming and concurrency. You\u2019ll learn how to make parallel web requests and interact with a database to show this off. The last few things the course discusses before its conclusion is polymorphism, specifications, and macros.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This workshop is 2 days long, with each day taking 10 hours to complete. It is divided into 12 bite sized sections, with each section having exercises to help you put the teachings into practice. In addition, there are 4 challenges spaced throughout the course where you\u2019ll stretch your skills to its fullest potential by trying out the tasks at hand.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td>GitHub<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Timothy Pratley<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Beginner<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td>20 hours<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td>None<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Fun Facts<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Timothy Pratley is the author of the book \u201cProfessional Clojure\u201d, and a contributor to the Clojure core language.

By the end of this course, you should be comfortable enough to start writing your own Clojure programs.<\/p>\n<p>The course assumes that you have prior programming experience.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course begins with an introduction to the REPL and Clojure\u2019s basic syntax. The REPL is something every Clojure programmer should get used to as part of <a href=\"https:\/\/practical.li\/clojure-staging\/repl-driven-devlopment.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">REPL driven development<\/a>. Then, you\u2019ll learn how to assign values with def and how to access the types of values.<\/p>\n<p>Next, you\u2019ll learn about a few data structures, like lists, vectors, sets, and hash maps. Data structures in Clojure have some quirks compared to other non-functional programming languages like immutability, so you\u2019ll get to know how to use them as well as the functions associated with them. Speaking of functions, you\u2019ll also investigate how functions work in Clojure, including higher-order functions where functions can accept functions as an input.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, you\u2019ll wrap up the course by talking about namespaces as well as atoms that act as a method of managing shared, synchronous, independent state.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 1 hour long.

If you want to practice your Clojure coding skills, this is the place.<\/p>\n<p>But what makes this course special from other exercise-based sites is that it provides free mentoring on code. If you are stuck with a particularly challenging exercise or you want to see whether your code could be improved, you can request mentoring and an experienced Clojure programmer will give you personalized feedback on it. Pretty cool!<\/p>\n<p>Also, the Clojure programming language happens to have a dedicated learning track with syllabus, so there is a set path of what exercises to take that\u2019ll teach you concepts slowly but surely.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>There are two sections to this course: learning mode and practice mode.<\/p>\n<p>In learning mode, you are required to solve learning exercises to unlock other exercises in the syllabus tree. This ensures that you won\u2019t suddenly get shocked by a problem way above your league. You\u2019ll learn concepts like conditionals, lists, strings, numbers, and sequential destructuring.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, practice mode contains exercises of three difficulties once you feel comfortable enough to tackle them head on.<\/p>\n<p>The easy exercises will have you reverse a string, translate from English to Pig Latin, and compute Pascal\u2019s Triangle.<\/p>\n<p>The medium difficulty exercises include calculating the date of meetups, matching brackets, and picking the best hand(s) from a list of poker hands.<\/p>\n<p>And the hardest difficulty of exercises will have you count the scored points on a Go board and reparent a graph on a selected node.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is self-paced, so you can take all the time you need to complete the 80+ hands-on programming exercises. Each exercise comes with automatic feedback of your code as well as personal mentoring to help you understand your code\u2019s strengths and
