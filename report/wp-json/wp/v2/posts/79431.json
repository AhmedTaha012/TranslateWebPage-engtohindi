It involves a three-step process:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>First<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, let me introduce myself. I\u2019m part of the Class Central team, and I (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@Elham\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">@elham<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) built this ranking in collaboration with my friend and colleague<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@manoel\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">@manoel<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We built this ranking by searching through our extensive database of 100K online courses and looking at features like ratings, reviews, and bookmarks. We sifted through the sea of online courses to bring you the very best out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, the best courses get around by word of mouth, but ratings and reviews don\u2019t tell the whole story. Some courses receive so much attention (especially some of the older courses: the classics!) that other excellent resources can go unnoticed. Hence, the next step was to bring our knowledge of online education into the mix.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Second<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we used our experience as online learners to evaluate each preliminary pick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We both come from computer science backgrounds and are prolific online learners, having completed about 45 MOOCs between us. Additionally, Manoel has an<\/span>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/open-university-insiders-perspective\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">online bachelor\u2019s in computer science<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, while I am currently completing my foundation in computer science.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We carefully analyzed each course and ranked them one by one. We bounced ideas off each other and made iterative improvements to the rankings, until we were both satisfied. That is the ranking you are reading right now!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Third<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, during our research, we stumbled across courses that we felt were well-made but weren\u2019t well-known. Had we adopted a purely data-centric approach, we would have to leave those courses out of the ranking, if only because they had fewer enrollments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, we favored a holistic approach. To spice up this ranking, we\u2019ve added a diverse range of AI courses that will hopefully appeal to each of our readers\u2019 taste buds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After going through this process \u2014 combining Class Central data, our experience as lifelong learners, and a lot of editing \u2014 we arrived at our final ranking. So far, we\u2019ve spent more than 15 hours building this ranking, and we intend to continue updating it in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Course Ranking Statistics<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some aggregate stats about the ranking:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most popular course in this ranking has around 756K enrollments.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All together, the course&#8217;s enrollments add up to a total of 1.5M enrollments.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8 courses are free or free-to-audit, while 2 are paid.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Together, they account for 700+ reviews at Class Central.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most represented course provider on this list is Coursera.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About 306K people are following <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/subject\/ai\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Artificial Intelligence Courses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Class Central.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without further ado, let\u2019s go through the top picks.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/independent-elements-of-ai-12469\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elements of AI (University of Helsinki)<\/span><\/a><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-79442 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/1.-Elements-of-AI-University-of-Helsinki.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/1.-Elements-of-AI-University-of-Helsinki.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/1.-Elements-of-AI-University-of-Helsinki-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/1.-Elements-of-AI-University-of-Helsinki-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My #1 pick for the best artificial intelligence course is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/independent-elements-of-ai-12469\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elements of AI <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by the University of Helsinki.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reason why this course is my top pick is because virtually anyone can start their AI-learning journey here and leave with impressive knowledge, whether you\u2019re a programmer or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course is open to everyone interested in learning what artificial intelligence is, what is possible (and not possible) with AI, and how it affects our lives \u2014 no complicated math or programming required!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course includes modules on machine learning, neural networks, the philosophy and ethics of artificial intelligence, and using artificial intelligence to solve problems.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course contains six modules: <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is AI?<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI problem solving<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">real world AI<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">machine learning<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">neural networks<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">implications (of AI)<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the first module, you\u2019ll learn how to define AI\u2009\u2014\u2009or rather how difficult it is to define. Autonomy and adaptivity are two key concepts for explaining and understanding AI, and you\u2019ll apply these to different fields of AI. You\u2019ll also explore basic philosophical problems like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Turing_test\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Turing test<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chinese_room\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chinese room thought experiment<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and their implications for AI.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many problems can be formulated as search problems, like the popular <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/River_crossing_puzzle\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">River crossing puzzle<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In the second module, you\u2019ll learn about AI search algorithms. You\u2019ll start by formulating a real-world problem as a search problem, drawing game trees and state diagrams of these problems. Often, there may be more than one solution to a problem but you want to find the best solution. By using the minimax principle, you&#8217;ll learn how to come up with an optimal solution, and prove it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third module deals with probability. Being uncertain may sound like a weakness, but when most natural phenomena are random, thinking in probabilities makes AI super powerful. You\u2019ll learn and apply the Bayes rule to infer risks in scenarios like the odds of having breast cancer given a positive test, as well as explain the base-rate fallacy and how to avoid it with Bayesian reasoning. Naive Bayes classification is based on the same methods and is used to detect spam emails in your inbox, among others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fourth and fifth module dive into the theory behind machine learning and neural networks, which are methods for AIs to learn and adapt to new information. There are two main categories of machine learning: supervised and unsupervised. You\u2019ll focus on learning a few supervised machine learning methods such as the nearest neighbor method, linear regression, and logistic regression. You\u2019ll learn what a neural network is, how they are built, and where they are currently being used with success.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the sixth module, you\u2019ll investigate the implications\u2009\u2014\u2009positive and negative\u2009\u2014\u2009 of AI. The biggest effect AI can have isn\u2019t technological, but political. The final module will help you better evaluate the claims made about AI, as well as identify some of the major societal implications of AI relating to algorithmic bias, AI-generated content, privacy, and work. This understanding will transform you into a much more informed individual, able to keep up with this fascinating, but potentially scary technology.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course is 6 weeks long, with each week taking 5 to 10 hours to complete. You\u2019ll learn primarily by reading the course\u2019s beautifully written articles, elucidated by illustrations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each article is usually accompanied by one or more exercises for you to complete to qualify for a free certificate.<\/span><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University of Helsinki<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginner<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">60 hours total<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Enrollments<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">750K<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Rating<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.8 \/ 5.0 (709)<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fun Facts<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">This courses includes a <strong>free certificate<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course has 41K bookmarks on Class Central.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have completed this course and want to make your own AI, there is a second part to this course: it\u2019s the <a href=\"#4\">fourth item in this ranking<\/a>.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has been <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/learndigital.withgoogle.com\/digitalgarage\/course\/elements-artificial-intelligence\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recommended by Google<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> course to start with if you\u2019re an AI beginner.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.elementsofai.com\/faq\/how-can-i-get-ects-credits\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It counts as 2 ECTS credits<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at the University of Helsinki Open University.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re interested in this course, you can find <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/independent-elements-of-ai-12469\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more information about the course and how to enroll here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/edx-cs50-s-introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-with-python-18122\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CS50&#8217;s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python (Harvard University)<\/span><\/a><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-79441 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/2.-CS50s-Introduction-to-Artificial-Intelligence-with-Python-Harvard-University.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/2.-CS50s-Introduction-to-Artificial-Intelligence-with-Python-Harvard-University.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/2.-CS50s-Introduction-to-Artificial-Intelligence-with-Python-Harvard-University-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/2.-CS50s-Introduction-to-Artificial-Intelligence-with-Python-Harvard-University-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My second pick for the best AI course is Harvard\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/edx-cs50-s-introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-with-python-18122\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CS50&#8217;s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re confident with Python and are willing to charge head-first into AI programming, you\u2019ll love this course.

By the end of the course, you\u2019ll be ready to take more advanced AI application courses involving the use of Scikit-learn, TensorFlow and Keras.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course starts by discussing the difference between NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow\u2009\u2014\u2009the three most important libraries in AI.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll begin by learning the ins and outs of the NumPy, a library widely-used in AI and machine learning. NumPy offers a clean and elegant way to express code, while also providing better performance than some of Python\u2019s functions. You\u2019ll work with NumPy arrays\u2009\u2014\u2009creating, operating, and modifying them to store massive amounts of numerical data.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Afterwards, you\u2019ll learn pandas, the bigger and badder brother of NumPy. It\u2019s a popular library for data analysis and manipulation, with a pandas DataFrame being the most common way to represent tables of data. This will be something you\u2019ll do a lot as an AI expert. You\u2019ll explore the magic of panda\u2019s DataFrame and how to modify and slice data, how to apply conditions, and a lot more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next section covers strings and input\/output. Strings in Python are incredibly simple to understand and operate on compared to other languages, and you\u2019ll see why in this walkthrough. You\u2019ll learn how to concatenate, split, and slice strings, as well how to convert them from ASCII to Unicode\u2009\u2014\u2009something that confuses a lot of beginners (I was one of them!). Lastly, you\u2019ll learn about panda\u2019s saving and reading files methods.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll then study how we can visualize data in Python. There are two main libraries used for data visualization: matplotlib and seaborn. Matplotlib is highly configurable but complex, whereas seaborn is simpler but less customizable. Anyways, you\u2019ll learn how to utilize both of them, and know when to use one over the other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final section of the course coers object oriented programming. You\u2019ll study how to define classes and initialize objects, as well as class inheritance and overriding methods. Finishing this course means that you are now prepared to take on new challenges. Congratulations!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course is 5 weeks long, with 8\u20139 hours worth of material. You\u2019ll learn by watching the lecture and walkthrough videos. If you are paying for the certificate, each week contains a quiz that\u2019ll test your knowledge of the material.<\/span><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coursera<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Youngsun Kwon<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginner<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">9 hours total<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paid<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fun Facts<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Actually, there is a course prior to this called <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/practical-python-for-ai-coding--preparation-for-c-55143\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Practical Python for AI Coding 1<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you can take if you are a complete beginner to Python programming.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This MOOC is also <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/kooc.kaist.ac.kr\/python4ai\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">offered in Korean<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re interested in this course, you can find <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/practical-python-for-ai-coding-2-55882\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more information about the course and how to enroll here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;ve put together a list of the best AI courses available online.
