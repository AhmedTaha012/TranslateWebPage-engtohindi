We end with a recognition of the biases that machine learning can amplify and how to recognize this.<br \/>\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/google-machine-learning-10446#reviews\">3 ratings<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/launching-machine-learning-10621\"><b>Launching into Machine Learning<\/b><\/a><br \/>\n<i>Google Cloud via Coursera<\/i><br \/>\nStarting from a history of machine learning, we discuss why neural networks today perform so well in a variety of data science problems. We then discuss how to set up a supervised learning problem and find a good solution using gradient descent. This involves creating datasets that permit generalization; we talk about methods of doing so in a repeatable way that supports experimentation.<br \/>\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/launching-machine-learning-10621#reviews\">2 ratings<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/intro-tensorflow-11075\"><b>TensorFlow on Google Cloud<\/b><\/a><br \/>\n<i>Google Cloud via Coursera<\/i><br \/>\nWe introduce low-level TensorFlow and work our way through the necessary concepts and APIs so as to be able to write distributed machine learning models. Given a TensorFlow model, we explain how to scale out the training of that model and offer high-performance predictions using Cloud Machine Learning Engine.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/feature-engineering-11074\"><b>Feature Engineering<\/b><\/a><br \/>\n<i>Google Cloud via Coursera<\/i><br \/>\nWant to know how you can improve the accuracy of your machine learning models? What about how to find which data columns make the most useful features? Welcome to Feature Engineering on Google Cloud Platform where we will discuss the elements of good vs bad features and how you can preprocess and transform them for optimal use in your machine learning models. In this course you will get hands-on practice choosing features and preprocessing them inside of Google Cloud Platform with interactive labs.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/art-science-ml-11073\"><b>Machine Learning in the Enterprise<\/b><\/a><br \/>\n<i>Google Cloud via Coursera<\/i><br \/>\nWelcome to the art and science of machine learning. In this data science course you will learn the essential skills of ML intuition, good judgment and experimentation to finely tune and optimize your ML models for the best performance. In this course you will learn the many knobs and levers involved in training a model. You will first manually adjust them to see their effects on model performance.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/gcp-production-ml-systems-11978\"><b>Production Machine Learning Systems<\/b><\/a><br \/>\n<i>Google Cloud via Coursera<\/i><br \/>\nIn the second course of this specialization, we will dive into the components and best practices of a high-performing ML system in production environments.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/mlops-fundamentals-22469\"><b>MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) Fundamentals<\/b><\/a><br \/>\n<i>Google Cloud via Coursera<\/i><br \/>\nThis course introduces participants to MLOps tools and best practices for deploying, evaluating, monitoring and operating production ML systems on Google Cloud. MLOps is a discipline focused on the deployment, testing, monitoring, and automation of ML systems in production.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/ml-pipelines-google-cloud-33505\"><b>ML Pipelines on Google Cloud<\/b><\/a><br \/>\n<i>Google Cloud via Coursera<\/i><br \/>\nIn this course, you will be learning from ML Engineers and Trainers who work with the state-of-the-art development of ML pipelines here at Google Cloud. The first few modules will cover about TensorFlow Extended (or TFX), which is Google\u2019s production machine learning platform based on TensorFlow for management of ML pipelines and metadata. You will learn about pipeline components and pipeline orchestration with TFX.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/training\/machinelearning-ai\/#data-scientist-learning-path\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Data Scientist \/ Machine Learning Engineer learning path<\/a>\u00a0via\u00a0<i>cloud.google.com<\/i><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Collaboration\"><a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/certification\/google-workspace-administrator\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professional Google Workspace Administrator<\/span><\/a><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Professional Google Workspace Administrator exam assesses ability to plan and implement Google Workspace authorization and access, control and configure Google Workspace services, monitor organizational operations, and advance Google Workspace collaboration.
