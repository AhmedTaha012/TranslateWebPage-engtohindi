Presumably, $80 million <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/mooc-hype-year-1\/\">came from MIT and Harvard<\/a>, and $40 million from partners\u2019 membership dues. Where the remaining $50 million came from is unclear.<\/p>\n<p>One thing seems clear, though: only MIT and Harvard are getting their money back and get to decide what to do with it; university partners and other donors who supported edX aren\u2019t getting anything, as far as we know.<\/p>\n<p>If edX was a for-profit organization, some of these contributors would have received stock and part of the proceeds of the sale. Instead, MIT and Harvard invested $80 million, raised $90 million from supporters without giving them equity, and are now pocketing $800 million. Something about this feels wrong.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">One of the cool things about being a &quot;nonprofit&quot; university is you can spin up a new business, pay taxes on nothing, sell the business to a publicly-traded corporation, pocket the $$$$, and still pay taxes on nothing.<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Kevin Carey (@kevincarey1) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/kevincarey1\/status\/1409892277665808384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 29, 2021<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"match\">EdX &amp; 2U: a Match Made in\u2026?<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_75858\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75858\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/mitx-first-course.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75858\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/mitx-first-course.png\" alt=\"6.002x Circuits &amp; Electronics: The first course of MITx (edX precursor)\" width=\"800\" height=\"973\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/mitx-first-course.png 800w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/mitx-first-course-247x300.png 247w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/mitx-first-course-768x934.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-75858\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">6.002x Circuits &amp; Electronics: The first course of MITx (edX precursor)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Regarding prices, edX and 2U started at the complete opposite ends of the spectrum.<\/p>\n<p>EdX\u2019s first course, taught by its CEO Anant Agarwal, was 6.002x Circuits &amp; Electronics. It <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/mitx-6-002x\/\">launched on MITx on March 5, 2012<\/a>. It was completely free, including a free certificate and free access to a textbook co-authored by Agarwal.<\/p>\n<p>2U\u2019s (formerly 2Tor) first online degree, an M.A. from the University of Southern California, went live in 2009. It cost <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/techonomy\/2012\/11\/05\/97500-for-an-online-degree-2u-is-worth-it-say-students\/\">$34k in tuition fees<\/a>. Since then, 2U has launched many online degree programs with a wide variety of <a href=\"https:\/\/2u.com\/partners\/\">university partners<\/a>. By acquiring Trilogy and GetSmarter, 2U also expanded into lower-price offerings.<\/p>\n<p>In 2020, the company earned $487 million from its Degree Program Segment and $288 million from its Alternative Credential Segment, which presumably includes Trilogy bootcamps and GetSmarter courses. Trilogy bootcamps cost around $10k. A Class Central analysis shows that GetSmarter courses cost $700\u2013$4400, with a median price of around $2k.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/ddfoqzqsu0zvp.cloudfront.net\/media\/documents\/2U_2019_Transparency_Report_1211.pdf\">2U\u2019s 2019 transparency report<\/a>, around 38% of 2U\u2019s total revenue was derived from Title IV loans \u2014 that is, US student financial aid. In addition, as you\u2019ll see below, Class Central found evidence that their Trilogy bootcamp students are also taking out personal loans to pay for the bootcamp.<\/p>\n<p>In short, each year 2U makes hundreds of millions of dollars by putting students into debt. As much as the leaders of 2U and edX want to convince us they are \u201cpurpose aligned\u201d, this is simply not true.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, MOOCs <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/mooc-trends-content-paywalls\/\">aren\u2019t as free as they used to be<\/a>, and many providers have fully paid offerings including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/mooc-based-masters-degree\/\">online degrees<\/a>. But they\u2019re not akin to 2U\u2019s online degrees, which are often just as expensive as their on-campus counterparts.<\/p>\n<p>Georgia Tech has three MOOC-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/mooc-based-masters-degree\/\">online masters degrees<\/a> ranging from $7k\u2013$10, two of them offered via edX. But a three-month Trilogy-powered bootcamp at Georgia Tech costs $10k.

By leveraging the power of these university brands, this works well for 2U.

It\u2019s probably a blended cost spanning their different pricing tiers:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>GetSmarter: ~$2k<\/li>\n<li>Trilogy Bootcamps: ~$10k<\/li>\n<li>Online Degrees: $25k \u2013 70k<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The higher the cost of the program, the higher the average cost of a single student acquisition.<\/p>\n<p>According to 2U, the edX acquisition can reduce these costs by 10\u201315%, resulting in $40\u2013$60M in annual savings. Here\u2019s their reasoning: if 2U could convert either:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>0.01% of edX\u2019s 120M \u201cmarketplace visits\u201d (I\u2019m assuming visits to edX.org); OR<\/li>\n<li>0.03% of edX\u2019s 39M registered learners;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>this would result in an extra 12k enrollments, reducing the mean acquisition cost from $3.9k to $3.5k.<\/p>\n<p>But there are two assumptions baked into this model that could make it fall apart.<\/p>\n<p><strong>First<\/strong>, the high cost of 2U programs make them inaccessible to most of the world.<\/p>\n<table>\n<caption style=\"caption-side: bottom;\">Coursera revenue per world region<\/caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td><\/td>\n<td><strong>2019<\/strong><\/td>\n<td><strong>2020<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">United States<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$90m<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$143.5m<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Europe, Middle East, Africa<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$52.1m<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$83.3m<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Asia Pacific<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$27.7m<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$40.7m<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$14.7m<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$26.m<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Total<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$184.4m<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$293.5m<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>Above is a table from my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/coursera-s1-analysis\/\">analysis of Coursera\u2019s IPO prospectus<\/a>. 51% of Coursera\u2019s revenue comes from outside the US. And Coursera\u2019s offerings are significantly cheaper than 2U\u2019s programs. It&#8217;s safe to assume that 70\u201380% of 2U\u2019s revenue, if not more, comes from the US.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, 80% of edX learners are outside the US. So we can estimate edX to receive about 24M \u201cmarketplace visits\u201d from US users and have 7.8M registered users in the US. To simplify the math, let\u2019s assume 100% of their revenue comes from the US. In this scenario, the estimated conversion rates required to reach the 10% savings target would be:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>0.05% of the 24M US \u201cmarketplace visits\u201d; OR<\/li>\n<li>0.15% of the 7.8M US registered learners.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So the actual conversion rates required would be just slightly lower. These targets are significantly more ambitious than those floated by 2U in their original model.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Second<\/strong>, edX itself hasn\u2019t done well converting their learners to their 13 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/mooc-based-masters-degree\/\">online degrees<\/a>, which are significantly cheaper than 2U degrees.<\/p>\n<p>We know this from edX\u2019s tax returns. In FY2020, edX had a \u201ctuition revenue\u201d of $3 million, up from $1.2 million a year before. By contrast, Coursera <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/coursera-q1-2021\/\">earned $29.9 million from its Degrees Segment<\/a> in 2020. EdX makes 10 times less from their degree programs than Coursera. While they have three times fewer learners and half as many degrees, this difference is still disproportionate. Put simply, edX has a hard time converting users to their degrees.<\/p>\n<p>And it seems edX has given up on its degree ambitions. In 2020, they announced just <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/edx-2020-review\/\">4 new degrees (and lost 1)<\/a>. In fact, it&#8217;s been a year since they last announced an online degree.<\/p>\n<p>So why does 2U think they can do better? It\u2019s because of their \u201cproven marketing engine\u201d.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"marketing\">Online Degree Marketing Engine<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_75860\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75860\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/2u-marketing-engine.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-75860\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/2u-marketing-engine-1024x579.png\" alt=\"2U\u2019s plan: Combining edX marketplace with 2U\u2019s marketing engine\" width=\"1024\" height=\"579\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/2u-marketing-engine-1024x579.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/2u-marketing-engine-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/2u-marketing-engine-768x434.png 768w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/2u-marketing-engine.png 1324w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-75860\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">2U\u2019s plan: Combining edX marketplace with 2U\u2019s marketing engine<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>In their investor presentation for the edX acquisition, 2U describes the edX \u201cmarketplace\u201d rather concretely, referencing numbers like social media following. By contrast, they described their \u201cmarketing engine\u201d rather vaguely, using terms like \u201cprogram-specific\u201d, \u201cmulti-audience\u201d, and \u201cmulti-channel\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Doesn\u2019t this seem odd? In 2021, 2U will spend upwards of $400M on marketing and sales, but how\u2019s that money used exactly?<\/p>\n<p>This is the dirty little secret of online degree marketing, and it\u2019s not limited to 2U. I\u2019ll try to describe it as generally as possible, because I have limited experience. But I do know a bit about it, since becoming part of this \u201cmarketing engine\u201d is precisely what kills aggregators like Class Central, which is why it\u2019s something we\u2019ve been careful to avoid.<\/p>\n<p>There are two parts to this marketing engine:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Acquiring \u201cleads\u201d \u2014 that is, potential students.<\/li>\n<li>Converting these \u201cleads\u201d into enrollments.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 id=\"step1\">Step 1: Lead Acquisition (Marketing)<\/h3>\n<p>Course aggregators like oedb.org and academicearth.org used to be similar to Class Central. That\u2019s until they were acquired by companies that help online degrees acquire leads. After the acquisitions, these aggregators changed a lot.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_75850\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75850\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/screenshot-ae-oedb.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-75850 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/screenshot-ae-oedb.jpg\" alt=\"OEDb\/Academic Earth Screenshot\" width=\"800\" height=\"659\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/screenshot-ae-oedb.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/screenshot-ae-oedb-300x247.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/screenshot-ae-oedb-768x633.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-75850\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">oedb.org (left) and academicearth.org (right) current homepages<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The homepages of both sites were overhauled to promote online degrees. The new versions had nothing to do with the original purpose of the websites.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Degree Finder\u201d or \u201cFind a Program\u201d that you can see on the homepages is how these sites make money. It can be extremely lucrative. In just a couple of clicks, they direct you to a degree program and ask you for your email, phone number, and more. If you show interest by filling the form, you\u2019ve just become a \u201clead\u201d \u2014 and the site owners can earn as much as $40 per lead.<\/p>\n<p>There might be other ways to acquire leads, but this is the one I\u2019m most familiar with. So when you have deep pockets, a common strategy to generate leads is to acquire sites that potential students might visit, or to create sites targeting specific search terms, so they rank high on Google.<\/p>\n<p>These sites pretend to provide helpful information to learners, often presenting themselves as impartial catalogs of the \u201cbest\u201d online degrees. But generally, they\u2019re just geared toward promoting specific degree programs \u2014 those of whoever they have a financial arrangement with.<\/p>\n<p>And there\u2019s another layer to this: there are entire companies out there that specialize in building and buying websites to help higher education institutions acquire leads.<\/p>\n<p>Let me demonstrate. Assume you\u2019ve never heard of Georgia Tech\u2019s groundbreaking <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/georgia-tech-master-computer-science-20929\">Online Masters in Computer Science<\/a>, which costs $7k and has become the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/georgia-tech-omscs-leaves-udacity\/\">world\u2019s largest master\u2019s degree program<\/a>. Go to Google and try to search for &#8220;online computer science masters&#8221; and see if you can reach the program&#8217;s homepage, omscs.gatech.edu, especially from degree aggregator websites.<\/p>\n<p>The huge marketing budgets of 2U and other Online Program Managers (OPMs) are making it difficult for prospective students to find accurate information about online degree offerings.<\/p>\n<p>2U itself runs a number of lead gen sites \u2014 for instance, mastersindatascience.com, onlinecounselingprograms.com, and onlinephysicaltherapyprograms.com. Check the websites\u2019 footers: they\u2019re \u201cowned and operated by 2U\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>This is why 2U was willing to fork over $800 million to acquire edX. In 2U\u2019s slide above, edX\u2019s \u201cmarketplace\u201d strengths are mainly described in terms of how well edX does on Google:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Top 5 education sites on Google<\/li>\n<li>#3 share of voice in non-branded search terms<\/li>\n<li>75 domain authority<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Last year, when I analyzed the SEO content strategy of Coursera, MasterClass, and edX, I noted that, combined, these companies get half a billion dollars worth of traffic from Google every year. At Class Central, around 60% of our 1+ million learners come from Google every month.<\/p>\n<table>\n<caption style=\"caption-side: bottom;\">Estimated Google monthly traffic (September 2020)<\/caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td><\/td>\n<td><a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/\">SEMrush<\/a><\/td>\n<td><a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\">Ahrefs<\/a><\/td>\n<td><a href=\"https:\/\/www.spyfu.com\/\">SpyFu<\/a><\/td>\n<td><a href=\"https:\/\/www.similarweb.com\/\">SimilarWeb<\/a><sup>a<\/sup><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Coursera<\/td>\n<td>7.6M<\/td>\n<td>7.8M<\/td>\n<td>16M<\/td>\n<td>11.6M (20%)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>edX<\/td>\n<td>3.4M<\/td>\n<td>3.9M<\/td>\n<td>5M<\/td>\n<td>4.07M (23%)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>MasterClass<\/td>\n<td>7.8M<\/td>\n<td>2.8M<\/td>\n<td>10M<\/td>\n<td>3.27M (50%)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Class Central<sup>b<\/sup><\/td>\n<td>604k<\/td>\n<td>261k<\/td>\n<td>849k<\/td>\n<td>1M (57%)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>a. <em>In parentheses: estimated fraction of traffic coming from search engines.<\/em><br \/>\nb. <em>In September 2020, Class Central\u2019s actual traffic was 766k, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/search.google.com\/search-console\/about\">Google Search Console.<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>In the future, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a native ad similar to \u201cThe Degree Finder\u201d or \u201cFind a Program\u201d on every edX page.

So how could this work? As someone who kinda built an online courses \u201cmarketplace\u201d, I have some ideas.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Combined listings<\/strong>: 2U products will be listed in edX\u2019s catalog. When you visit edX and search for a course, you\u2019ll see programs from edX and 2U combined, with 2U products potentially given priority.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Email marketing<\/strong>: registered users might start receiving targeted emails regarding 2U programs based on their activity on the website. For instance, if you enrolled in a data science course, they will send you promotional emails for data science degrees or GetSmarter courses.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Landing pages<\/strong>: 2U might also take advantage of edX\u2019s strong presence on Google to create specific landing pages for their online degrees or bootcamps.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>My advice to learners: if edX asks you for your phone number in the future, don\u2019t give it to them. Actually, don\u2019t give your phone number to any course provider.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"vs\">Coursera vs edX<\/h2>\n<p>In my opinion, to put it bluntly, Coursera is better than edX for both universities and learners.<\/p>\n<p>On Coursera, universities:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can reach more learners.<\/li>\n<li>Earn more without paying a membership fee.<\/li>\n<li>Provide better financial aid (free vs edX\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/support.edx.org\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/215167857-How-do-I-apply-for-financial-assistance-\">90% off<\/a>).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For learners, on Coursera:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Courses are more open (edX has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/edx-paywall-graded-assignments\/\">time-based paywalls<\/a>).<\/li>\n<li>The user experience is better (edX UX hasn\u2019t changed much over the years).<\/li>\n<li>Certificates are cheaper.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Some of the learner benefits I\u2019ve listed might also be favored by universities, like an unlimited audit mode. Vice versa, some university benefits might be favored by learners, like better financial aid.<\/p>\n<p>Like I did with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/coursera-s1-analysis\/\">Coursera\u2019s IPO filing<\/a>, I dug into edX\u2019s tax returns to see how much money they\u2019ve given their partners earned over the years.<\/p>\n<table>\n<caption style=\"caption-side: bottom;\">Cost &amp; gain of partnering with edX<\/caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Fiscal year ending in June<\/strong><\/td>\n<td><strong>Membership Dues<\/strong><\/td>\n<td><strong>Royalties<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2020<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6,676,979<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">38,579,123<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2019<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7,149,809<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">24,631,270<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2018<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7,449,454<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">19,247,734<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2017<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8,089,816<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">13,728,543<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2016<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6,351,691<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8,436,336<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2015<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4,010,218<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4,019,119<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2014<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">554,998<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">509,641<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2013<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">0<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">0<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Total<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">40,282,965<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">109,151,766<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>Analyzing edX\u2019s 2013\u20132020 tax returns, I found that they paid their partners $110 million in royalties. But edX also charges its partners \u201cmembership dues\u201d for offering courses on the platform, amounting to $40 million. So since it was founded, edX has given $70 million net to its partners.<\/p>\n<p>Contrast this with Coursera who has paid its content creators $281 million just in 2017\u20132020 (not counting degree revenue). In 2020 alone, Coursera partners received over $100 million.<\/p>\n<p>From a financial standpoint, Coursera is clearly the better partner for universities. So this raises a question: why do some universities exclusively partner with edX?<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"advantage\">EdX\u2019s (Surrendered) Ideological Advantage<\/h2>\n<p>Some argue this acquisition threatens Coursera. I suspect the opposite: it could make Coursera even stronger, since edX is surrendering its biggest, and possibly only, defence against Coursera. Let me explain.<\/p>\n<p>Based on conversations that I\u2019ve had over the years with industry actors, edX&#8217;s advantage boils down to a single word: \u201cnonprofit\u201d. Some universities simply prefer to partner with nonprofits like edX rather than VC-funded companies like Coursera.<\/p>\n<p>EdX\u2019s nonprofit status helped compensate for some of its shortcomings. Over the years, they\u2019ve wielded this status to secure exclusive partnerships with universities, despite charging membership fees. Coursera, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t charge membership fees, and they\u2019re significantly better at monetization.<\/p>\n<p>So I believe edX losing its nonprofit status could make some universities rethink their partnerships, creating an opportunity for Coursera to convince some of them to offer courses on their platform, or even switch platforms entirely.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"partners\">EdX\u2019s (No Longer Exclusive) Partnerships<\/h2>\n<p>But MIT has already <a href=\"https:\/\/news.mit.edu\/2021\/mit-harvard-transfer-edx-2u-0629\">announced<\/a> it\u2019ll launch a new platform called MITx Online based on Open edX, specifying that \u201c<em>MIT faculty may choose to continue to offer their courses through the new edX after the transaction is completed, or move them to MITx Online<\/em>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The announcement adds that edX\u2019s acquisition \u201c<em>imposes no restrictions on these institutions\u2019 [i.e. edX partners] freedom to offer their courses through other means, or to depart edX.<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To me, this provision signals that some faculty might not be comfortable offering their courses on a for-profit platform, so they\u2019ve been provided a way out.<\/p>\n<p>According to their <a href=\"https:\/\/openlearning.mit.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/inline-files\/MITxImpactReport2020_site_final.pdf\">2020 impact report<\/a>, MITx accounted for 4.4 million learners and 9.6 million edX enrollments. Basically ~10% of edX\u2019s learners are enrolled in MIT courses. And some of these courses might now move to MITx Online. So this acquisition already cost edX their exclusive access to the offerings of one of the world\u2019s most famous universities.<\/p>\n<p>Does edX have a plan to retain these institutions? EdSurge <a href=\"https:\/\/www.edsurge.com\/news\/2021-06-29-2u-buys-edx-for-800m-in-surprise-end-to-nonprofit-mooc-provider-started-by-mit-and-harvard\">tried to ask<\/a> the 2U CEO what he\u2019s doing to convince colleges to stay:<\/p>\n<p>He said the company has long believed that \u201c<em>universities are in control, 2U is not<\/em>\u201d when it comes to any partnerships with the company. \u201c<em>We have to do right by the stakeholders every single day<\/em>,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>Basically a non-answer from a seasoned executive.<\/p>\n<p>Some universities like the University of Michigan <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/umich-moocs-coursera-edx-futurelearn\/\">are already multi-platform<\/a>, sometimes offering the same course on Coursera, edX, and FutureLearn. One of my colleagues, <a href=\"http:\/\/classcentral.com\/@pat\">@pat<\/a>, took Dr. Chuck\u2019s popular course Programming for Everybody <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/programming-course-comparison\/\">on each platform and compared them<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"pbc\">Public (Not Much) Benefit Corporation<\/h2>\n<p>As part of the acquisition, EdX is becoming a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), just like Coursera did before <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/coursera-s1-analysis\/\">going public earlier this year<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>EdX and Coursera like to pretend this is some high bar that\u2019ll hold them accountable. The reality is quite different. Here\u2019s the line that Coursera added to its Certification of Incorporation that made it possible to become a PBC:<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;The specific public benefit purpose of the Corporation is to provide global access to flexible and affordable high quality education that supports personal development, career advancement, and economic opportunity.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I believe most online course providers could claim the same and become PBCs. Terms like \u201caffordable\u201d and \u201chigh quality\u201d are relative. Given the cost of education in the US, even a $20k bootcamp can argue it\u2019s affordable.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"plans\">Edx\u2019s Turnaround Plans?<\/h2>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">2U\u2019s people, technology, and scale will expand edX\u2019s ability to deliver on our mission and enable all learners to unlock their potential. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/freetodegree?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#freetodegree<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; anant agarwal (@agarwaledu) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/agarwaledu\/status\/1409840807155224576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 29, 2021<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p>In 2021, 2U will spend as much on just marketing and sales as Coursera will spend in total.<\/p>\n<p>As detailed earlier, 2U has been very specific on how edX fits into its plans: reducing their user acquisition costs.

At a minimum, for edX to grow and be able to compete with Coursera, 2U would need to invest hundreds of millions of dollars over the next few years. But is 2U willing to do that? Scratch that. Can 2U even afford to do that?<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"cashcrunch\">2U\u2019s Potential Cash Crunch<\/h2>\n<p>In FY2020, edX earned $84.7M, with operating losses of $17.4M. But $11.5M of this revenue came from grants and membership dues, which are both under threat once edX becomes part of 2U. So the losses might further increase.<\/p>\n<p>Before the edX acquisition, 2U expected 2021 losses in the range of <a href=\"https:\/\/investor.2u.com\/news-and-events\/press-releases\/news-details\/2021\/2U-Reports-Results-for-First-Quarter-2021\/\">$165M to $175M<\/a>. To acquire edX, 2U took out a loan of $475 million \u201cwith attractive terms\u201d. But if I understand it correctly (and I probably don\u2019t), the loan term is 3.5 years with \u201c~$42 million of annual interest expense\u201d, according to the investor presentation.<\/p>\n<p>So this means 2U is taking an additional expense of ~$178 million a year to acquire edX. 2U\u2019s losses are going to increase for the next few years, even if they hit the peak of their $40\u2013$60M savings estimate facilitated by the edX acquisition.<\/p>\n<p>At the <a href=\"https:\/\/investor.2u.com\/news-and-events\/press-releases\/news-details\/2021\/2U-Reports-Results-for-First-Quarter-2021\/\">end of Q1<\/a>, 2U had $505 million in cash balance, and it just spent $325 million acquiring edX. edX FY2020\u2019s expenses were about $100M. Will 2U be able to invest another $50\u2013$100 million per year to grow edX?<\/p>\n<p>Maybe if 2U\u2019s stock price keeps going up, they\u2019ll be able to secure another loan. But this puts edX at the whims of the \u201cmarket\u201d. Perhaps I\u2019m over-analyzing and there\u2019s always money in the <s>banana stand<\/s> public markets. We\u2019ll know some of the details soon, when 2U releases their 2021 Q2 report and guidance for the rest of the year.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"thoughts\">Final Thoughts<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019ve made it this far, you probably have figured out by now that I\u2019m extremely disappointed with this development. As someone who\u2019s followed edX and the MOOC space since day 1, this just looks like capitulation.<\/p>\n<p>For years, edX presented itself as a morally superior alternative to Coursera due to its nonprofit status. But now, they\u2019re relegated to the status of a \u201cmarketplace\u201d that might push thousands of learners into debt.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>2U is acquiring edX for
