It was designed in 1996 by Xavier Leroy and his team at INRIA in France as an extension of the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/ML_(programming_language)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Meta Language<\/a> Caml dialect. Although Caml had a powerful type system and functional programming capabilities, it was only ever used in academia. However, by incorporating features such as object-oriented programming while retaining the correctness and conciseness of its predecessor, OCaml became a suitable language for building practical, real-world applications (which is what the O in OCaml formerly stood for Objective, if you were wondering).<\/p>\n<p>OCaml&#8217;s strong type system, inherited from its predecessors, helps ensure code is safe and correct by catching errors at compile-time, while maintaining the flexibility of untyped languages by performing type inference. Not only that, OCaml\u2019s algebraic data types allows for powerful pattern-matching capabilities, making it easy to match, extract and manipulate data in a concise and expressive way.<\/p>\n<p>Many of OCaml\u2019s features encourage programming in the functional style, such as preferring recursion and higher-order functions over traditional loops and preferring immutable data structures over mutable ones. However, it acknowledges that certain tasks\u00a0 such as working with files and writing in-place algorithms can be difficult to accomplish using only functional methods. As a result, OCaml offers support for multiple programming paradigms like imperative and object-oriented programming, giving developers flexibility to choose the best paradigm for their problem.<\/p>\n<p>OCaml is also known for performance and ability to easily integrate with other languages, such as C and JavaScript, making it a great choice for building multi-language systems.<\/p>\n<p>As for its applications, OCaml is widely used in academia and research institutions, with many universities like Cornell and Princeton including it in their curriculum to teach functional programming. And although OCaml is relatively niche compared to other languages, it has been used in <a href=\"https:\/\/ocaml.org\/industrial-users\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">several large-scale industry projects<\/a> by companies such as Facebook for compilers and static analysis, Jane Street for guaranteeing the correctness of their internal trading systems, Coq for checking mathematical theorems, and Bloomberg for advanced financial derivatives risk management application.<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-79247 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png\" alt=\"Find your next course.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Best Courses Guides Methodology<\/h2>\n<p>I built this ranking following the now tried-and-tested methodology used in previous Best Courses Guides (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/category\/best-courses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">you can find them all here<\/a>).

The course will begin by showing the use of OCaml as a functional programming language alone, and by the end, it\u2019ll demonstrate how OCaml can be utilized as a multi-paradigm language, combining functional and imperative programming styles to get the best of both worlds.<\/p>\n<p>To follow this course, you should already have some basic knowledge of writing simple computer programs in a programming language.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll begin the course with an overview of the language, starting with its robust type system. OCaml is statically-typed language, but thanks to its flexible type inference you\u2019ll find yourself working with the type-checker rather than against it, and even create your own types. Combined with immutable data structures, such as tuples, records, and trees, you\u2019ll see how they can be used effectively in your programs.<\/p>\n<p>As a functional-first programming language, OCaml emphasizes the concepts of functional programming (FP), including the use of recursion over loops and the treatment of functions as first-class citizens. You\u2019ll gain hands-on experience with key FP concepts such as partial function application, map and fold operations, and more.<\/p>\n<p>By now, you\u2019ve probably gotten a good understanding of how functional programming differs from imperative programming. Imperative programming is useful in some cases though, so you\u2019ll explore OCaml\u2019s imperative constructs such as modules, input\/output, and exceptions.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 6 weeks long, with the total video watch time adding up to 7 hours.

You&#8217;ll explore OCaml&#8217;s powerful static type system, including its basic types such as integers, floats, booleans, strings, and characters. Additionally, you&#8217;ll be introduced to the concepts of recursion and higher-order functions, and understand why they&#8217;re often preferred over loops.<\/p>\n<p>As you move on, you&#8217;ll delve into lists and pattern matching. You&#8217;ll learn how to create and add elements to lists in OCaml, and discover how they can be composed of different types using tuples. You&#8217;ll see the power of lists and tuples through practical examples of pattern matching.<\/p>\n<p>Taking a step back, you\u2019ll delve into higher-order functions, focusing on the functions that operate on lists such as List.map, List.filter, List.fold_left, and List.fold_right.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, the course will cover advanced concepts like parametric polymorphism, which allows types with free variables to be replaced with any type, and inductive types, which are programmer-defined types created using the &#8220;type&#8221; keyword in OCaml. You&#8217;ll see an example of this by creating a &#8220;message&#8221; type with different constructors for string, bool, and float messages, and then defining a list of message types and writing a function that iterates over them.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 3\u20134 hours long.

Snake and Lumines both run on your computer, whereas Frogger runs on your web browser. Afterward, you can choose between several more advanced projects, such as writing a IRC bot, implementing <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/junegunn\/fzf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">command-line fuzzy finder<\/a>, or improving Frogger.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>Two types of exercises are given: small coding exercises and large projects. Small coding exercises test your understanding of different programming aspects of the OCaml language, whereas the larger projects provide the opportunity to apply your knowledge and skills to more complex, real-world problems. You\u2019ll need to pass the `expect` tests in order to fully complete the exercises.<\/p>\n<p>The course also provides a few paths you can take after completing the exercises, but these come without `expect` tests.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Jane Street<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td>OCaml<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Beginner<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td>N\/A<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Stars<\/b><\/td>\n<td>390<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td>None<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Fun Facts<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Jane Street is a quantitative trading firm.
