Instead, Scala is very flexible and supports multiparadigm programming, so the smart developer can choose the most appropriate paradigm to follow when writing code. This is especially true in data processing, when it makes more sense to model data as objects but process them with pure functions for better parallelization. Additionally, Scala can compile to Java Bytecode (as well as machine code and JavaScript), and it is interoperable with Java code.<\/p>\n<p>Scala is the implementation language of many important frameworks, including Apache Spark, Kafka and Akka. Not only that, it has been used extensively in industry as infrastructure for tech giants such as Twitter, Netflix, and Spotify. There are a lot of Scala jobs available on the market, with Scala being one of the most high-paying languages at $92,780 per year according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/survey.stackoverflow.co\/2022\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stack Overflow Developer 2022 Survey<\/a>.

Additionally the specialization ends with a capstone project, where you\u2019ll implement a complete application capable of processing gigabytes of data about temperatures all over the world.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll should have one year of experience with any programming language (preferably with Java or C#, but any other language works).<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The first course of the specialization will show you the common traits of functional programming, like higher-order functions, function composition, and pattern-matching, and you\u2019ll learn how to apply them in everyday programming tasks. You\u2019ll also be able to reason about functional programs through proofs of invariants and symbolic tracing of execution.<\/p>\n<p>The second course adds on to the first course by teaching you even more ways to apply the functional programming style when designing larger Scala applications. You\u2019ll be able to address a variety of problems using functional programming concepts like laziness, monads, combinatorial search, and more.<\/p>\n<p>With the recent advent of commercial parallel hardware, parallel programming is becoming more and more important. The third course addresses the basics of parallel computing, from a theoretical and a practical aspect. You\u2019ll find that the Scala standard library is production-ready for parallel computing.<\/p>\n<p>In the fourth course, you\u2019ll think even bigger, applying functional concepts across machines instead of individual processors, otherwise known as distributed computing. One of the reasons you\u2019ll want to do this is when you encounter massive datasets up to hundreds or even thousands of gigabytes.<\/p>\n<p>And finally the fifth and final course is where everything you\u2019ve learned throughout the specialization culminates in a capstone project where you\u2019ll build a large data-intensive application using real-world data.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This specialization is 30 weeks long with 7 hours a week, with a combined total of 210 hours of study time. Throughout the courses, you\u2019ll complete many quizzes and build small to medium size Scala applications to apply what you\u2019ve learned into practice.

Whereas other courses in this ranking may be more OOP-focused, this course will teach all the basics and even some advanced features in Scala within a functional perspective\u2009\u2014\u2009no knowledge of FP required.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>After setting up your development environment, you\u2019ll learn the basic Scala programming concepts like values, variables, types, conditionals, loops, and operators. Then, you\u2019ll move onto functions and see the role function plays in functional programming with important concepts like higher-order functions, anonymous functions, and recursion. You\u2019ll be drilled on these deeply.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, you\u2019ll need to know how Scala does OOP with classes, inheritance, and subtype polymorphism. Additionally, pattern-matching, exceptions, and collections will be taught to flesh out your knowledge. Finally, you\u2019ll get to know what Algebraic Data Types are as well as one of Scala\u2019s most controversial features, implicits.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 3\u20134 hours long.

By the time you\u2019ve completed the course, you\u2019ll be able to code in Scala following many different programming paradigms and techniques!<\/p>\n<p>This course is designed for second year undergraduate students, who mostly have experience of imperative languages (Python and Java), so background knowledge of programming is needed.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course begins by introducing you to the basic Scala syntax through the familiar context of imperative programming and object-oriented programming. That means you\u2019ll be able to implement any program you\u2019ve developed in your previous programming language. But Scala-specific concepts will be introduced as well, like its type system, Futures and Promises, and Actors.<\/p>\n<p>Next, you\u2019ll explore the functional paradigm. A lot of foreign concepts will be taught, like how functions can be values, laziness, immutability as first-class citizens, pattern matching, and more. Additionally, you\u2019ll learn about category theory, a branch of mathematics influential to functional programming, which involves learning about the dreaded Monoids and Monads. Finally, the last few sections of the course will teach you how to deal with massive streams of events using asynchronous and reactive programming.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course consists of 11 chapters. You\u2019ll learn by watching the lecture videos and reading the slides given. There are also practicals where you\u2019ll be given tasks or problems to solve. Solutions for these practicals are also available.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td>University of New England<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Will Billingsley<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Intermediate<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td>N\/A<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td>None<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Fun Facts<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.une.edu.au\/staff-profiles\/science-and-technology\/william-billingsley\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">William Billingsley<\/a> is an Associate Professor in Computational Science, Computer Science at the School of Science and Technology.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">You can find <a href=\"https:\/\/www.une.edu.au\/study\/units\/functional-and-reactive-programming-cosc250\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">course information on the university\u2019s website here<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in this course, you can find <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/theintelligentbook-willscala-117481\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more information about the course and how to enroll here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"anchor-7\">7. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/scala-exercises-117485\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Scala Exercises (Scala Exercises)<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-83973\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/7.-Scala-Exercises-Scala-Exercises.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/7.-Scala-Exercises-Scala-Exercises.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/7.-Scala-Exercises-Scala-Exercises-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/7.-Scala-Exercises-Scala-Exercises-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/scala-exercises-117485\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i>Scala Exercises<\/i><\/a> is an open source project for learning different technologies in Scala.
