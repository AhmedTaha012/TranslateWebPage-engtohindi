Traditionally used in literature, it\u2019s increasingly been used in other types of writing to keep readers engaged. In that sense, it\u2019s a powerful tool for copywriting, storytelling, novels, poems and so on.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine you are sitting at your computer and you need to send an article to your editor in a couple of days. You look at your keyboard and then swiftly move your eyes to the cursor blinking on the screen. \u201cAt least I\u2019ve already put a title on it\u201d you say aloud. You hear a sound and from the window you see some kids playing outside. You put on some shoes, grab your pocket-size-notebook and pen and walk through the door. \u201cSome fresh air is all I need\u2026 How am I gonna keep this gig If I can\u2019t even get started? Maybe, I am not supposed to be a writer, I should have kept working with Uncle John. The money was ok to bear with his constant bad mood.\u201d You keep thinking as you look around and realize you\u2019re in a park where people are having a picnic. \u201cHoly moly, it\u2019s Sunday. You know what? I\u2019m gonna enjoy the rest of the afternoon here.\u201d You lie down on the grass and start to hear people\u2019s laugh, it\u2019s a family riding bikes down the lane. Birds are playing in the trees above your head. You tap in your front pocket where your notebook is, take the pen with it and scribble some words as the fresh air touches your face and blows your hair. \u201cWhy does it have to be so difficult for me while others can write so easily? I lack the words, the feeling, the depth, the soul.\u201d you write, and the notebook talks back to you controlling your hands like a puppeteer: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you can take it out of your chest. But, tell me: why do you want to be a writer? What are your dreams?\u201d asks the wise notebook\u2026 And now it\u2019s time for you to answer and continue this story!<\/p>\n<p>Creative writing is a skill that can be learned and practiced just like any other. In this short story, which represents a novice writer\u2019s everyday struggle, I\u2019ve used the following techniques: ABDCE structure, 2nd person point of view, \u201cshow don\u2019t tell\u201d, dialogues, trope, and object personification.<\/p>\n<p>What is the importance of creative writing? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/06\/19\/science\/researching-the-brain-of-writers.html\">Research<\/a> has shown that professional writers&#8217; brains work differently from novice writers\u2019. Creative writing has been shown to <a href=\"https:\/\/greatergood.berkeley.edu\/article\/item\/how_creative_writing_can_increase_students_resilience\">increase resilience in students<\/a>. So, if you want to reap most of the benefits of writing, you need to create the habit of jotting down your words and thoughts, and possibly it will help you overcome the writer\u2019s block.<\/p>\n<p>Creative writing is so powerful that It has been used in prison to give the incarcerated population an opportunity to express their voices in programs like <a href=\"https:\/\/pen.org\/prison-writing\/\">PEN America<\/a>: \u201cby providing resources, mentorship, and audiences outside the walls, we help these writers to join and enrich the broader literary community\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>What exactly entails creative writing? According to <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Creative_writing\">Wikipedia<\/a>, \u201ccreative writing is any writing that goes outside the bounds of normal professional, journalistic, academic, or technical forms of literature, typically identified by an emphasis on narrative craft, character development, and the use of literary tropes or with various traditions of poetry and poetics. Due to the looseness of the definition, it is possible for writing such as feature stories to be considered creative writing, even though they fall under journalism, because the content of features is specifically focused on narrative and character development.\u201d Therefore, creative writing has a broad scope. In this ranking, I hope to show some of its facets.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-79248 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-2.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-2-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-2-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h1>Course Ranking Methodology<\/h1>\n<p>I followed a three-step process to build this ranking:<\/p>\n<p><b>First<\/b>, I\u2019m part of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/\">Class Central<\/a>, the leading search engine for online courses. We have a database of 100K online courses and over 200K crowdsourced reviews. So it seemed like the natural starting point.<\/p>\n<p>I started by leveraging the database to make a preliminary selection of Creative Writing courses, looking at things like ratings, reviews, and course bookmarks. So this was a purely data-driven step, relying on hard metrics to create an initial ranking that we could then iterate upon and expand.<\/p>\n<p>Using this approach, some of the top picks rapidly became apparent, since the best courses tend to have rave reviews. But I didn\u2019t stop there. Ratings and reviews rarely tell the whole story. So the next step was to bring my personal knowledge of online education into the mix.<\/p>\n<p><b>Second<\/b>, I used my experience as an online learner to evaluate each of the preliminary picks.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve participated in a few <a href=\"https:\/\/nanowrimo.org\">online writing challenges<\/a> and in-person workshops. My profile <a href=\"https:\/\/nanowrimo.org\/participants\/nunseik\">on NaNoWriMo<\/a> was created in Nov 2012. Therefore, I have taken enough courses to tell apart the ones worth spending your time.<\/p>\n<p><b>Third<\/b>, during my research, I came across courses that felt well-made but weren\u2019t well-known. If I adopted a purely data-centric approach, I would have to leave those courses out of the ranking, if only because they had fewer enrollments.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, I favored a holistic approach. I\u2019ve included more personal picks that hopefully surprise those of you who have already seen or taken the more popular Creative Writing courses and are looking for something a bit different as in \u201c10-day Journaling Challenge\u201d and some nonfiction writing courses.<\/p>\n<p>After going through this process \u2014 combining Class Central data, my experience as a lifelong learner, and a lot of editing \u2014 we arrived at our final ranking. So far, I\u2019ve spent more than 16 hours building this ranking, and I intend to continue updating it in the future.<\/p>\n<h1>Course Ranking Statistics<\/h1>\n<p>Here are some aggregate stats about the ranking:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Together, they account for 768,021 enrollments, without accounting for the YouTube views.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Skillshare, with 2 courses, is the most featured provider in the ranking.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The single most popular course in the ranking has over 200k enrollments.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Three courses are entirely free or free-to-audit, four courses are in the affordable range (from $10 to $49), and the other three require subscription (Skillshare and MasterClass).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h1 id=\"anchor-1\">1. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/youtube-2020-creative-writing-lectures-at-byu-53045\">Creative Writing by Brandon Sanderson (YouTube)<\/a><\/h1>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-78887 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Banner.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Banner.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Banner-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Banner-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>My first pick for the best creative writing course is for <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/youtube-2020-creative-writing-lectures-at-byu-53045\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Creative Writing by Brandon Sanderson<\/a><\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Brandon Sanderson is a prolific writer and recently he\u2019s dropped a whole series of secret novels he wrote during the pandemic. You can check his explanation in the video <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6a-k6eaT-jQ\">It\u2019s Time to Come Clean<\/a>. Besides being an awesome writer, Sanderson has also made available a full course in creative writing on YouTube with the most crucial tools for any beginner or even experienced writers. It\u2019s comprehensive and rich in content with great sound-video quality.<\/p>\n<h2>What you\u2019ll learn<\/h2>\n<p>Brandon Sanderson starts his first lecture on his philosophy in teaching writing by saying: \u201cso here\u2019s the thing. I can\u2019t teach you how to be a\u00a0 writer. I just can\u2019t. Writing is a skill that you have to practice on your own. And I can generally\u00a0 give you some nudges, some tips, some hints, and some tools. And that is my focus in this class.\u00a0 It\u2019s a focus on giving you as many tools as you can possibly hold, as many as I can give you, so\u00a0 that when you are doing your own writing you have them in hand and can try different things out. The longer I\u2019ve been a professional novelist, the more I\u2019ve realized that these sorts of tools are really handy for troubleshooting, even for me in my career right now. If I have a problem in a book, I go back to these sorts of fundamentals that I talk about in the class.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>How you\u2019ll learn<\/h2>\n<p>The tools will be covered in each video, so you might refer back to them any time or watch it all in one sitting. It\u2019s up to you. I personally recommend you to take your time, experiment with each new concept on your own, or even better, find a writing partner or alpha reader, someone who can read your stuff without being overly judgmental of your progression.<\/p>\n<p>The lectures will cover the following topics: Plot, Viewpoint, Worldbuilding, Short Stories, Characters, and Publishing.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Brigham Young University<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Youtube<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor(s)<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Brandon Sanderson<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Beginner<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td>15 hours<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Views<\/b><\/td>\n<td>992,643 views<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Rating<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Over 35K thumbs up<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Not available<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h2>Fun Fact<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Brandon Sanderson has launched a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/dragonsteel\/surprise-four-secret-novels-by-brandon-sanderson\">kickstarter project<\/a> this year that has received over $25M in 7 days.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in this course, you can find <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/youtube-2020-creative-writing-lectures-at-byu-53045\">more information about the course and how to enroll here.<\/a><\/p>\n<h1 id=\"anchor-2\">2. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/craft-of-plot-5625\">Creative Writing: The Craft of Plot (Wesleyan University)<\/a><\/h1>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-78888 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Banner1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Banner1.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Banner1-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Banner1-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>My second pick is for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/craft-of-plot-5625\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Creative Writing: The Craft of Plot<\/em><\/a> by Wesleyan University.<\/p>\n<p>This course is for those looking for a way to improve their writing structure. It starts by defining what a plot is, then, how structure and outlines can help organize the stories you want to tell, how to write effective scenes and the twenty-one point checklist for revision and editing. It\u2019s somewhat a short course, with writing practice (for paying learners) and insightful interviews. It\u2019s worth your time and effort in case you are a messy writer like myself, it brings valuable tools for your planning, structuring, and editing.<\/p>\n<h2>What you\u2019ll learn<\/h2>\n<p>This course provides a framework for your plot, how you can structure your plot and each specific scene and it ends with editing and revision.<\/p>\n<p>Some other topics covered in this course: ABDCE Structure, How Structure and Outlines Can Help Organize Your Plot and the Story You Want to Tell.<\/p>\n<h2>How you\u2019ll learn<\/h2>\n<p>Each week has 3 lectures about 7-8 minutes long and ends with a peer-graded assignment (assignment not available for audit only option).<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that the most common complaint for this course is that it\u2019s peer-graded. You will eventually get insightful feedback for your assignments. What I do recommend though is reviewing more than 3 assignments, this way you can learn from others in the course. Generally speaking, this is a common issue for most online writing courses, the instructors will rarely give their feedback in your assignment.
