The language\u2019s speed, flexibility, stability, and direct control over hardware are some of the major reasons behind why many programmers, especially software engineers and game developers, love the language.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, C is the second most popular language in the world according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiobe.com\/tiobe-index\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TIOBE index<\/a>, and forms the backbone of many applications, from operating systems to embedded systems to game engines to trains and even programming languages like Python.<\/p>\n<p>Hence, due to C\u2019s wide range of uses, it is easy to fill in any number of roles within a company. Many employers are looking for programmers with C experience and, according to Glassdoor, the estimated total pay for a C Developer is $113K a year.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-79247 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Best Courses Guides Methodology<\/h2>\n<p>I built this ranking following the now tried-and-tested methodology used in previous Best Courses Guides (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/category\/best-courses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">you can find them all here<\/a>).

You\u2019ll learn a robust problem-solving process called the Seven Steps to help you develop an algorithm, how to read and understand code, and the Everything is a Number Principle.<\/p>\n<p>No programming experience is needed prior to taking this course.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The first module introduces an effective process for solving any programming problem \u2014 the Seven Steps. You\u2019ll learn how to approach a programming problem methodically to formulate a precise and correct algorithm. At this point, you should have a basic grasp of developing simple algorithms.<\/p>\n<p>In the second module, you\u2019ll learn to read code, which means executing code line-by-line by hand and clearly illustrating what each statement does and what the program\u2019s state is. Understanding how to read code is the only way to ensure you aren\u2019t blindly writing code! By the end of this module, you will be able to read and understand code with functions, conditional statements, iteration, and other fundamental techniques.<\/p>\n<p>In the third module, you\u2019ll learn about types beyond integers, conceptual representations, and hardware representations in binary. Everything is a number to a computer, but types determine the size and interpretation of numbers. You\u2019ll study the basic data types, \u2018non-number\u2019 types, and complex custom types, as well as some important caveats, to avoid type-related programming mistakes.<\/p>\n<p>The fourth and final module will entail developing and testing your own algorithm for sorting data. This will help reinforce the importance of being specific when writing an algorithm and provide an opportunity to perform a very common computational task: sorting.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course is 4 weeks long, with 18 hours worth of material. You\u2019ll primarily learn through video lectures along with supplementary reading materials and practice quizzes to test your understanding.<\/p>\n<p>For paying learners, each module ends with a graded quiz that\u2019ll count towards achieving your certification.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Duke University<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Coursera<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Andrew D.

You\u2019ll rigorously build up your knowledge of C and programming in general piece by piece, and by the end of the course you\u2019ll be able to move on to more advanced programming.<\/p>\n<p>No prior knowledge of coding is needed for this course.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll begin this course with a brief history of the C language and understand its philosophy to help you guide you when understanding what it means to compile, debug, and run a program. You\u2019ll then learn how to write and run your own simple program where you\u2019ll convert one unit to another.<\/p>\n<p>Just as languages have rules on spelling and grammar, C also requires you to follow its rules to write proper C code. But unlike human languages where some minor spelling or grammar mistake may still be comprehensible, even one minor error in your code will prevent C from compiling your code! Hence, you\u2019ll not only learn to write proper code but also good C code by making your code easy to read.<\/p>\n<p>The course also introduces you to a bunch of essential programming concepts that you\u2019ll need to know in order to write programs that tackle real-world problems. You\u2019ll begin by learning about conditional statements and loops which help you control the flow of your program and functions which help you reuse code and think recursively.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, the course ends with a valuable lesson on arrays and pointers\u2009\u2014\u2009concepts which trip even the most experienced of programmers if they are not careful. You\u2019ll see these ideas in action when you study sorting algorithms like bubble sort and merge sort.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 6 weeks long with 15 hours worth of material. You\u2019ll learn primarily from watching lecture videos and participating in the discussion forum.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a paying learner, you\u2019ll have access to the graded quizzes and peer-graded programming exercises where you\u2019ll look at fellow learners&#8217; programs. You\u2019ll end this course with a final exam that\u2019ll assess everything you\u2019ve learned throughout the course.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td>University of California, Santa Cruz<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Coursera<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Ira Pohl<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Beginner<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td>15 hours total<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Enrollments<\/b><\/td>\n<td>192K<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Rating<\/b><\/td>\n<td>4.5 \/ 5.0 (5.2K)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Paid<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Fun Facts<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The course has 365 bookmarks on Class Central.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in this course, you can find <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/c-for-everyone-16909\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more information about the course and how to enroll here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"anchor-3\">3. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/edx-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science-442\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CS50&#8217;s Introduction to Computer Science (Harvard University)<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-80811\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/3.-CS50s-Introduction-to-Computer-Science-Harvard.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/3.-CS50s-Introduction-to-Computer-Science-Harvard.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/3.-CS50s-Introduction-to-Computer-Science-Harvard-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/3.-CS50s-Introduction-to-Computer-Science-Harvard-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>My third pick for the best C programming course <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/edx-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science-442\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>CS50&#8217;s Introduction to Computer Science<\/em><\/a>, offered by Harvard University on edX. Although this course is more focused on getting a general overview of computer science than C programming per se, the course does introduce programming newbies to the C language in a really engaging way, with detailed explanations and challenging exercises to boot!<\/p>\n<p>Launched on edX in 2012, CS50 is <i>the<\/i> computer science course on the internet. It is famous for its splendid production quality and its yearly curriculum updates.<\/p>\n<p>It provides a succinct but comprehensive overview of what computer science is all about. Whether you are a newbie who has never heard of \u2018Hello World!\u2019, or a programmer who knows a thing or two about computers, you\u2019ll come out of this course having learned something new.<\/p>\n<h3>One Thing to Note<\/h3>\n<p>Although the course exercises come in two versions, easy and challenging, I found that even the easy exercises can be a bit tricky! If you know nothing about programming, I\u2019d recommend you find someone to study this course with. Fortunately, CS50 has one of the largest and most active course communities online: check <a href=\"https:\/\/discord.gg\/cs50\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">their Discord<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Or if you\u2019re looking for a shorter, more practical course, you might want to have a look at my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freecodecamp.org\/news\/best-python-courses\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Python ranking<\/a>, which includes some gentler on-ramps into the world of programming.<\/p>\n<h3>The Instructor<\/h3>\n<p>CS50 can\u2019t be discussed without bringing up <a href=\"https:\/\/cs.harvard.edu\/malan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">David J. Malan<\/a>, the Harvard professor that teaches the course. Rarely has an instructor been so instrumental to the success of a course. Beyond being an excellent educator, Prof. Malan is a true entertainer, with near-perfect delivery. And when you\u2019re tackling an academic course that may take you dozens of hours to complete, having an instructor capable of capturing the learner\u2019s attention makes a huge difference.<\/p>\n<p>So if despite a sincere desire to learn, you find yourself falling asleep while taking online courses, this might just be the course for you. Prof. Malan\u2019s energy is contagious!<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course begins with the premise that computer science is, at its core, problem solving. It introduces you to binary, the fundamental language of computers, and explains how sequences of 1s and 0s can somehow represent text, images, videos, and even sounds!<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll learn that algorithms are step-by-step instructions designed to solve a problem. The most common type of algorithms you\u2019ll deal with throughout the course are algorithms for <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sorting_algorithm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sorting<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Search_algorithm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">searching<\/a>, like bubble sort, merge sort, and binary search. You may wonder, \u2018What\u2019s the point of having many different algorithms if they all do the same thing?\u2019. This is when you\u2019ll learn about measuring the efficiency of an algorithm with <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Big_O_notation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Big O notation<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The first programming language the course teaches is the beginner-friendly language Scratch. Through block-based coding, Scratch will be used to illustrate fundamental programming concepts for you, before removing your training wheels and dragging you down into the depths of low-level programming languages.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll begin your first deep dive into traditional programming with C, a low-level programming language. You\u2019ll spend a few weeks coding in C, where you&#8217;ll manage memory by hand and implement your first data structures.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll learn that computers store data in sequences of locations in memory, and how computers can locate and access data with addresses and pointers. You\u2019ll also learn about the different ways we can create and store lists of values, like arrays, linked lists, and trees. You\u2019ll compare the advantages and disadvantages of each data structure. For example, hash tables can be accessed in constant time, but require mitigating the risk of data collision.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll then be brought back up to the surface towards \u201chigher-level\u201d programming, where you\u2019ll be able to comfortably breathe as you begin working with Python, and continue jumping from topic to topic. You\u2019ll explore SQL, the programming language of many databases. The final weeks of the course culminate in you building and designing an interactive website with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a Python framework called Flask.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course is ten weeks long, plus an open-ended final project that might take an extra week (or more, if you want to work on something really ambitious). The course is recorded annually on-campus at Harvard before being launched online the following Spring. While the recording is ongoing, you might be able to join via live stream with a hundred other learners, or if you live near campus, even attend in person \u2014 though the pandemic might preclude this for the foreseeable future. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have access to on-demand recordings on edX or <a href=\"https:\/\/cs50.harvard.edu\/x\/2021\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">via Harvard OCW<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Regarding assessments, you\u2019ll complete ten problem sets, eight labs and a final end-of-course project that you\u2019ll have to design and come up with yourself or with a team.

You\u2019ll learn the reason is because every other characteristic is treated as a trade-off in relation to performance, for example, increased security might mean degradation of performance. Hence, programmers need to optimize for performance as much as they can so that they can also focus on all of these other qualities.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll start by learning about matrix multiplication and how programs perform then. You\u2019ll learn about Bentley rules for optimizing work, a.k.a performance of programs. Moving on, you\u2019ll learn about assembly language and computer architecture and the kind of measures taken by the compiler when C is compiled to assembly language.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also learn about multicore programming and parallelism, a popular topic in the last few decades. You\u2019ll then learn about storage allocation and caches which help cut down on the time spent transferring data between memory and the CPU.

Here, you\u2019ll learn about microprocessor architecture that defines the capabilities of a microprocessor and how it determines the machine language it runs on. You\u2019ll study the basic instruction set of a machine language.<\/p>\n<p>Then, you\u2019ll move on to studying C, a low-level language but more abstract than machine language. You\u2019ll compare how C works in relation to inline assembly, such as data types, multiplication, and swapping variables.<\/p>\n<p>Compiling C to assembly language takes place in the third week of the course, where you\u2019ll take a look at compiling a simple C program to assembly. Topics included are passing parameters, prologue and epilogue, and local variables.<\/p>\n<p>The final week involves some special functions like memcpy and strlen in C and C++. You\u2019ll also learn about recursion and how they compare with loops, specifically looking at factorial as an example.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 4 weeks long. You\u2019ll primarily learn by watching the lecture videos and following along with the instructor.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Indian Institute of Technology Madras<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td>YouTube<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Janakiraman Viraraghavan<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Intermediate<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td>4 weeks long<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td>None<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Fun Facts<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">SWAYAM is a programme initiated by the Government of India whose objective is to provide the best learning resources to all, including the most disadvantaged.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Janakiraman Viraraghavan is an assistant professor at the Electrical Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology Madras.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in this course, you can find <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/swayam-c-programming-and-assembly-language-13934\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more information about the course and how to enroll here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"anchor-10\">10. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/edx-introduccion-a-la-programacion-en-c-tipos-de-datos-y-estructuras-12156\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Introducci\u00f3n a la programaci\u00f3n en C: Tipos de datos y estructuras (Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid)<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-80805\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/10.-Introduccion-a-la-programacion-en-C_-Tipos-de-datos-y-estructuras-Universidad-Autonoma-de-Madrid.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/10.-Introduccion-a-la-programacion-en-C_-Tipos-de-datos-y-estructuras-Universidad-Autonoma-de-Madrid.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/10.-Introduccion-a-la-programacion-en-C_-Tipos-de-datos-y-estructuras-Universidad-Autonoma-de-Madrid-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/10.-Introduccion-a-la-programacion-en-C_-Tipos-de-datos-y-estructuras-Universidad-Autonoma-de-Madrid-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you know Spanish, then this <b>free-to-audit 5 weeks limited-access <\/b>course by Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid will be excellent for you!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/edx-introduccion-a-la-programacion-en-c-tipos-de-datos-y-estructuras-12156\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Introducci\u00f3n a la programaci\u00f3n en C: Tipos de datos y estructuras<\/em><\/a> (or Introduction to C Programming: Data Types and Structures) introduces you to the basic concepts that will help you develop the necessary programming skills to code in C.<\/p>\n<p>There are no prerequisites for this course.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>After setting up your programming environment, the first module begins with an introduction to reading and writing data. Next, you\u2019ll learn how to read input from the keyboard and report information to the computer screen with C.<\/p>\n<p>The second module concerns itself with basic data types and operators. You\u2019ll learn how to compute data in C by storing it in variables and performing calculations. Additionally, you\u2019ll learn about ASCII, an encoding standard for text.<\/p>\n<p>In the third module, you\u2019ll learn about arrays and strings, two essential concepts every programmer must know. You\u2019ll learn how to create arrays, access data from them, and work with strings.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, in the fourth module, you\u2019ll learn about basic data structures. You\u2019ve encountered a data structure before, an array. A data structure is a way of storing complex data.
